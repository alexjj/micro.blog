			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently started <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/">geocaching</a>. This is certainly not a new thing, the site is celebrating its 25th year! I do remember looking at it years ago but I think at the time I would&rsquo;ve needed to buy a GPS device. Although that doesn&rsquo;t seem quite right as my phone would&rsquo;ve had GPS. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t sign up and I&rsquo;ve only been doing it a week or so. It&rsquo;s fun and I&rsquo;ve found some places locally I never knew of.</p>
<p>Here are a few photos of the caches I&rsquo;ve found - including one on the top of Schiehallion munro!</p>

			 <p>Last night I finished the final book in the series&hellip;at about 2am! It&rsquo;s a fantasy series set in a medieval style world with magic and dragons written by <a href="http://www.robinhobb.com/">Robin Hobb</a> (a pen name of Margaret Ogden). It consists of 16 books in five trilogies (one is a trilogy in four parts (tetralogy ?)), and has in the region of 4 million words. It&rsquo;s like Game of Thrones, except it&rsquo;s not brutal and miserable! First published in 1995 and finalising in 2017, it is quite the epic.</p>
<p>I started at the beginning of 2023 after just finishing re-reading Lord of the Rings, having not read it for around 20 years. I pretty much only read the series in 2023 and powered through the last trilogy this year, after getting the books for christmas. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t start in 1995 and have to wait 22 years to get to read the final one. I feel like I&rsquo;ve been tired for the past year, either due to playing on the computer too late or not being able to put the books down when I read before bed&hellip;and sometimes both!</p>
<p>I do enjoy starting a new book when you know the world and the characters. New ones come along but it&rsquo;s so easy to pick up and keep going. It&rsquo;s probably why my <a href="/notes/books">reading list</a> is full of series. Foundation, Discworld, Wheel of Time, The Stormlight Archives and so on.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://thewertzone.blogspot.com/2021/10/the-longest-sff-novels-series-of-all.html">this website</a> comparing the length of sci-fi/fantasy series, and this set is number two only to the Wheel of Time. It was surprising to see it above Discworld, with its 40 odd books, but they are more modest of length compared to the tombs that Hobb and Jordan write.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really want to write a detailed review, as I&rsquo;m not very good at it and there are some many better ones online, but I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys a good story. There&rsquo;s sadness and bad times but they do end satisfactorily, other than wishing there were more.
<img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/realm.jpg" alt="Auto-generated description: A collection of book covers from Robin Hobb&rsquo;s The Realm of the Elderlings series is displayed, showcasing multiple trilogies and stories."></p>
<p>After reading nothing else for 14 months, I&rsquo;m not sure what to start now. There seem to be lots of recommendations on reddit for Lois Bujold&rsquo;s The Chalion series, but perhaps they&rsquo;re too similar. If I want to go more sci-fi then I&rsquo;ve been reading about the Children of Time series by Adrian Tchaikovsky. At some stage I do want to re-read the Discworld series. It&rsquo;s been about 16 years since I started that. However, I think I should try something new first.</p>

			 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s government has decided that from next year (from a tax perspective) they&rsquo;ll be adding <em>another</em> tax band to Scotland. A 45 per cent income tax band for earnings between £75,000 and £125,140. Plus fiddling with the ranges and percentages of the other bands.</p>
<p>So from the 6th April 2024 these will be the rates:</p>

<p>The personal allowance (0%) remains the same at £12,570 (regardless of inflation, <strong>cough</strong> stealth tax <strong>cough</strong>) and the reduction of this between £100,000 to £125,140 by £1 for every £2.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of making myself a financial forecasting tool to figure out how much I should split between my ISA and pension, in the naive attempt to be financially independent by the time I&rsquo;m 50. The first part of that was making a function to calculate income tax, and whilst I was making it, I thought it might be interesting to see how these income tax changes impact everyone&rsquo;s salary, from £0 to £200k.</p>
<p>For the record, here&rsquo;s England&rsquo;s tax bands:</p>

<h2 id="the-code">The Code</h2>
<p>The personal allowance is a funny thing, and took me a while to figure out how to calculate it correctly. Working this out is not a new problem so I looked on Github and it seemed people either did a whole load of <code>if</code> statements or some clever but unintelligible (by me at least) <a href="https://github.com/HJEGeorge/tax_calculator/blob/master/tax_tools.py#L178">numpy matrix math</a>.</p>
<p>The best way I found to understand it and calculate it such that I could pass various bands and percentages, was to remove the personal allowance from your income and the tax bands that were under £100k, in something that looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">calculate_scottish_income_tax</span>(income, bands, rates, allowance<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">12570</span>):

</code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;d also created a function to determine the personal allowance:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>My function takes a list of the bands and percentages. As I couldn&rsquo;t think of another way to do it whilst keeping it simple I just add a trillion pounds to the upper end of the bands. A trillion isn&rsquo;t entirely necessary, but I figured it should cover most of the population.</p>

<p>Obviously above £75k it has changed, but actually at the lower amounts it has changed too. Generally, slightly better as the band ranges have changed. Although if you earn £15k a year, I&rsquo;m not sure how much you&rsquo;ll notice the £1.44 extra, given the double digit inflation and Brexit consequences.</p>
<p>Check out that steep gradient between £100k and £125k, the loss of the personal allowance makes it a very high marginal rate of tax.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just have a look at the change between them to make it more obvious.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/a26060e8c3.jpg" alt="Delta between tax years" title="Delta between tax years"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://digitalpublications.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefings/Report/2023/2/27/e0888682-8f9a-46f0-9448-5a588c583f58">median earnings in Scotland</a> is £27,710, so how does that person fair? Well as I&rsquo;ve already alluded to, they are better off&hellip;by £10.17 a year. (Final tax home pay will of course depend on lots of things, including national insurance, which I&rsquo;ve not got to yet).</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Without getting too political, there are the numbers. Make of it what you will. Here&rsquo;s England vs. the new Scottish bands.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/080e2af6ea.jpg" alt="Delta between Scotland and England" title="Delta between Scotland and England]"></p>
<p>The graph doesn&rsquo;t win awards for comprehension, so the hint is, Scotland costs more. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Here we are, the evening of the last day of the year (at least when I started writing this, took me a few more days to finish!) and I wonder what did happen? I also wonder what will come next year? This time last year I did make a list in <a href="https://dynalist.io/">dynalist</a> of what I wanted to do in 2023, and I thought I should probably look back on it before I (blindly) make 2024&rsquo;s list. I also decided to rank myself red, yellow, green on what I achieved. Doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s been that great, with five red, four yellow and only one green. I also have one blue.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the good and work down. The only one I gave myself a green was for journaling. This consists of the family journal in DayOne, my idle chatter blog, and this site. I wasn&rsquo;t perfect by any means, and I&rsquo;m only 140 DayOne entries for this year, which is about 40% of the year. However, the weblogs were reasonable. I think a good target for 2024 would be 50% of the year but otherwise continue has I&rsquo;ve been. I do have a few draft posts for this site I&rsquo;ve yet to write, so maybe something more specific for next year, like 1 post per month, would be a good target.</p>
<p>On to the yellows. The four in this category are sleeping, reading, working and spending. Where the objective was to do more, more, smarter, and less respectively. I&rsquo;m more of a night person, but with young kids I&rsquo;m always awake at 6-6:30am every day, so if I go to bed by 10pm and read, I&rsquo;m usually okay. It&rsquo;s the nights where it&rsquo;s 11 or later that I go to bed and then by the time I fall asleep it could be midnight or later. I usually feel pretty poor the next day. I scored myself yellow as sometimes I&rsquo;m good but other times I&rsquo;m very bad. Reading follows sleeping in that most of my reading is done before I go to bed, but if I stay up too late too often then I&rsquo;m too tired to read. The area I&rsquo;m lacking for reading is with some of the non-fiction books I have. Many are sat on the shelf and have been for several years, and I wanted to read them. I don&rsquo;t, however, want to read them in the evening when I&rsquo;m going to bed as I won&rsquo;t remember them and I also want to take a few notes from them. I&rsquo;d just never pick sitting and reading a book in the evening vs. all the other things I want to do.</p>
<p>Working is all about being more organised, tracking actions, managing notes, spending less time &ldquo;multitasking&rdquo;, checking emails etc., and get more things done. This is mixed and I know I have areas to improve.</p>
<p>The final yellow is about buying less stuff. I&rsquo;ve got a bit addicted to looking at hotukdeals, and it has probably led to buying more things - although great deals! One thing that hasn&rsquo;t helped, is taking up amateur radio. This has led to buying more things, which I wouldn&rsquo;t have, but it&rsquo;s a fun hobby so I just need to keep it sensible. Definetly seen the impact of inflation this year, and not spent the time to work out the summary of this year&rsquo;s spending&hellip;hopefully it&rsquo;s less than what we earnt!</p>
<p>Now to the reds. 🚨</p>
<p>First up, is exercise more. In my defence I cycle to work each day, so I don&rsquo;t do nothing, but I bought a rowing machine in 2022 and haven&rsquo;t used it in about 16 months, and I told myself I&rsquo;d use it this year. Laughably, I set my target as three times a week.</p>
<p>I wanted to print more photos and to write more letters to people, ideally combining both and potentially using the typewriter. Did a pretty poor job of those.</p>
<p>Now these two are funny ones, on one hand I wanted to spend less time on the computer but on the other I wanted to play more computer games. What I really meant was spend less time on the computer <em>doing nothing</em>. e.g. browsing the web, looking at hotukdeals, watching youtube, researching things I&rsquo;ll never do, etc. I knew it would be hard to break the habit of sitting down on the computer and so I thought a good counter to that would be to actually play some computer games. I like playing computer games too. They often have good stories or challenging puzzles to figure out, and I enjoy playing multiplayer with my friends as we chat whilst playing them. Also, I have so many games that I&rsquo;ve bought over the years but never played&hellip;thank you Steam sales.</p>
<p>Finally, I gave myself a blue badge. This was for my &ldquo;projects&rdquo; section, which originally had ideas for various websites, or uses for all these SBCs and accessories that seem to be lying around. I didn&rsquo;t actually do any of them, however, as I ended up getting my amateur radio licence I built a lot of things related to that. So I did some projects - quite significant ones for me - but none of the original list. This didn&rsquo;t fit with how I categorised green and yellow so blue it is.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve looked back, let&rsquo;s turn around and look forward and try and learn from what happened. Easy said than done.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s a website, <a href="https://onetypedpage.com/">onetypedpage.com</a>, which is just that. Each day people submit a photo of their typed page and it gets hosted on this blog. I&rsquo;ve known about it for a long time but only recently started going back to it. There appears to be some comments about moderation and conflict, but as far as I ever saw it was a quiet enjoyable site to read through with a cup of tea.</p>

<p>This morning I decided I&rsquo;d submit a post to it. It&rsquo;s not there yet but maybe later today or tomorrow it will be. It&rsquo;s mostly a letter about nothing. Here it is:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Seen a few <a href="https://baty.net/2023/11/subscriptions-2/">posts</a> recently with people listing their subs. Thought I&rsquo;d join in.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t like subscriptions, and would much rather pay once and be done with it. Once you join and commit, they have you, it can be hard to leave. The upside is that if you don&rsquo;t like it, it&rsquo;s minimal expense to stop. Photoshop used to be hundreds of pounds but now it&rsquo;s just ten. Of course in those days, 30 day demos or similar were common. Anyway here goes (Monthly prices):</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Prime - £95 per year (£7.92 per month)</li>
<li>Netflix - £16 increasing to £18. We have premium to get downloads on more than two devices.</li>
<li>TV licence - £13.25. Required to watch BBC, even via iPlayer. A weird one.</li>
<li>Spotify - £10.99. Currently just premium for my wife, but we have had the family one in the past.</li>
<li>Apple iCloud 50 GB - £0.99</li>
<li>HP instant ink - £4.49. This is for 100 pages a month. I could probably drop down a level, we had a brief patch of printing a lot but think that&rsquo;s past. £2.99 gives 50 pages a month.</li>
<li>Domains - I&rsquo;ve seem to have spent £75 (£6.25/m) this year on six domains. Can definitely cancel one and I should investigate transferring them elsewhere.</li>
<li>Liteserver VPS - €26.40 per year (£1.93 /m). A Black Friday deal. Might see what they have again this year and transfer if it&rsquo;s cheaper. Although less hassle just to stay</li>
<li>MXRoute email hosting - $5 per year (£0.25/m). Another Black Friday deal from years and years ago. I just keep it as it couldn&rsquo;t be matched again. Don&rsquo;t even use it though&hellip;</li>
<li>Two SIM only phone contracts for us - £8/m each. Usually sign up for another deal each year to reset the price.</li>
<li>Tesco delivery saver - Currently about £0.20 per month but only as we used clubcard points to buy vouchers for this. It&rsquo;s £29.94 for 6 months of offpeak delivery.</li>
<li>Amazon kids+ - £38 per year (£3.17/m). Did get last year on a promo for £20 but haven&rsquo;t seen any recently. We have two Kindle fires which the kids play on and having access to everything is pretty good. They&rsquo;ve got a lot of use out of it. If I can find another promo that would be good, although the annual fee just hit recently so maybe not much scope in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: £83.44 per month</p>
<p>That includes netflix increase, which will put it at 22% of the total, with TV licence next.</p>
<p>Other subscription services we use but only when free, generally via promos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple music</li>
<li>Apple TV</li>
<li>Disney+</li>
<li>Oracle free VPS</li>
</ul>
<p>I debate about getting Apple One for 2TB of storage, music, TV, and to some extent apps. The kindle fires are ancient, and were $20 refurbs from 2018, but still going. However, at some stage I suspect they&rsquo;ll die and we probably won&rsquo;t replace them, but rather we&rsquo;ll have enough hand-me-down iPads to take their place. This plus the likeihood our eldest will get a phone next year means that the free apps might be useful. The 2 TB of storage would be nice to then backup all my photos into Photos.app and enjoy the benefit of that. TV is nice add-on, which I wouldn&rsquo;t pay for separately. Music would be great if we could leave Spotify. We think Spotify is a better app to use, and works much better with streaming to our house speakers (powered by Google Chromecast audio). Better off paying for family spotify as I think everyone would rather have it. This just then makes Apple One not that worthwhile. If I want the photos back up then I should just pay the £7/m for the storage.</p>
<p>My wife does have yoga apps she subscribes to, not sure the current status of those but likely paid annually, and maybe there are some other annual things lurking that I&rsquo;ve forgotten about.</p>
<p>So not too bad overall. I keep thinking about raising the subject of cancelling Netflix but it does get watched a lot by everyone.</p>

			 <p>I have to admit my previous <a href="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/a-little-writing-nook/">one</a> has become overwhelmed with things that there is no longer anywhere to write. It is now home to radio books and magazines, a few other books I keep meaning to read, a <a href="https://alexjj.com/posts/2022/hobonichi-first/">Hobonichi</a> I&rsquo;ve yet to write in, and more. I keep meaning to tidy it up.</p>
<p>We recently inherited a nice bureau from my wife&rsquo;s grandparents, and her mum kindly brought it up to our house. We also got various little knick-knacks, house items, recipe books and consumable things like notepads and sewing stuff. Still to find homes for it all but the first thing I wanted to test out was the bureau.</p>
<p>![Now I&rsquo;m creative](<a href="https://alexjj.com/blog/2023/A">alexjj.com/blog/2023&hellip;</a> new writing nook/writing-nook-1.jpg &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m creative&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d actually forgotten it had drawers at the bottom, which is slightly disappointing as I can&rsquo;t tuck a chair under it when not in use, but they are very handy for storing paper and notebooks etc. I even think I could store the Olivetti in one. That would be ideal. Even though I like having the typewriter out in the office on the desk, it does take up a lot of space.</p>
<p>By far the most exciting part is all those cubbies for trinkets and mysteries! My nanna used to have a bureau in her house, and as a child I remember finding it open some days and just poking about in all the little sections. There were so many things packed into it. It also contained all her correspondence and home admin, just nothing was organised, at least not how any of us could see. It was in the dining room, and so when it was dinner time she could just close it up and everything looked tidy, even though behind that door was a mess of papers and objects.</p>
<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll keep ours a little tidier than that!</p>
<p>![Analogue level: All](<a href="https://alexjj.com/blog/2023/A">alexjj.com/blog/2023&hellip;</a> new writing nook/writing-nook-2.jpg &ldquo;Analogue level: All&rdquo;)</p>
<p>The office refurb we did was, and still is, great. There is so much desk space available for all sorts of things at the same time. However, it&rsquo;s where the computer sits and boy is it hard for me to sit down in the office and NOT go on the computer. It really takes a lot of effort to write with a pen or the typewriter and I&rsquo;ve essentially done none in a long time. Amateur radio has also been a big cause of doing nothing else but amateur radio, but even before that I was doing very little. My best periods of writing where when we were on holiday this summer, where I wrote everyday. There, I&rsquo;m out of my routine and there&rsquo;s no autopilot sit on the computer.</p>
<p>Now with this new writing nook, away from the computer, my intent is that I will reestablish my routine. The only issue is that it&rsquo;s in the hallway, and so everyone will hear the typewriter, but that&rsquo;s a minor detail I can work around&hellip;probably by getting everyone some ear plugs for christmas.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2efe78a23c.jpg" alt="Radio setup outside" title="Radio Alfresco"></p>
<p>Several years ago, when we were living in California, I started thinking about getting my amateur radio licence. I don&rsquo;t remember why I started on this, but it seemed like something I&rsquo;d enjoy and be interested in. I didn&rsquo;t end up doing anything, as you had to sit exams at test centres and it wasn&rsquo;t convenient. I soon forgot about it and did nothing more. Last summer, the same thoughts occurred to me again, not sure why, but I started looking into radio. This time what it takes to be licenced in the UK.</p>
<p>All that resulted in passing my foundation licence in December 2022 in the online exams by the <a href="https://rsgb.org/">RSGB</a>. I&rsquo;d spoken to a friend about it in the summer, and he got interested. We both did the Essexham foundation training course, which runs online for a few weeks. He ended up passing first, which encouraged me to get on with booking my exam.</p>
<p>The content isn&rsquo;t difficult, but there&rsquo;s a lot of specific things you just need to remember. The exams &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have trick questions&rdquo; but often have word games or a particular way of asking questions which can make them harder than you&rsquo;d think. I probably should&rsquo;ve read the foundation manual as well.</p>
<p>It took until January before I actually got my licene from ofcom, the postal strikes and christmas holidays meant it took a while. I then got to pick my callsign online. There weren&rsquo;t many options to pick from and so ended up with something that, to me, sounded reasonable - MM7RVP. My callsign is M7RVP, but being in Scotland means I have to put in the other M. People in England don&rsquo;t have to use any letters (except for intermediate licence), which is a little annoying but I suppose the UK couldn&rsquo;t have too many designated letters.</p>
<p>I then did nothing for 4 months. Well, not nothing but I didn&rsquo;t use my callsign on the air. I mostly debated what I wanted to buy - if anything. Radio transceivers (transmitters and receivers in one) aren&rsquo;t that cheap. Probably not a high volume electronics item like computers and TVs, so are still pricey. Used gear is cheaper but after the initial depreciation, they then to hold their prices well. My friend and I were in the same boat, what do we get, is it worth it etc. He did buy a VHF/UHF setup, which is good for local contacts, but what&rsquo;s the most fun is HF. HF is the frequency range (3-30 MHz) that can go all around the world in the ionosphere.</p>
<p>Like most electronic things, there is no one perfect device. Perhaps the £10,000 one could be classed as that, but it&rsquo;s £10k and therefore not perfect 😅. We both had a similar shortlist of radios and spent many evenings debating the trade offs of them.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/b7aa4727d0.jpg" alt="My first radio: Xiegu G90" title="My first radio: Xiegu G90"></p>
<p>One day I saw one on the UK&rsquo;s used <a href="https://www.hamradiodeals.co.uk/">ham radio forum</a>, and that sold it for me. It was in great condition and I could easily sell it for what I paid for it, £350, if I needed to. I bought a Xiegu G90. This is a chinese brand radio, has a small but usable screen with a waterfall and does 20W on the HF bands. My foundation licence only allows 10W so it&rsquo;s ideal. I was all sorted. Well&hellip;with a radio, I still needed an antenna.</p>
<p>Picking a radio is very easy in comparison to picking an antenna. I think you never really pick one, you just make one, try it, and then make more and try them. Maybe you find some are better than others, or maybe they&rsquo;re just different. I don&rsquo;t know yet, as I&rsquo;ve only had one so far but picking that was tricky.</p>
<p>There are so many factors in picking an antenna, and it really depends on the space you have and what you&rsquo;re willing to do. My aim was easy to install and would be decent enough to get me going.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, I went with what&rsquo;s called an end fed half wave (EFHW) antenna, for the 40m band and up, making it 20m of wire. It works well on many bands, and the internal tuner on the Xiegu even gets a couple of others out of it.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/c38b1e4d6b.jpg" alt="Ready to put up the antenna" title="Ready to put up the antenna"></p>
<p>Armed with a big mug of tea, I was ready to put up the antenna. I would attach to the balcony on the first floor, and to a pole at the end of the garden. Or so I planned. Turned out the pole I bought was quite weak and bendy.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3867772c7d.jpg" alt="A bit too bendy" title="A bit too bendy"></p>
<p>The pole is 6 m tall but with the flex, the antenna was only about 3-3.5m off the ground. (I later read it would be better to thread it through a loop on the pole and tie it off on the ground, so that the pole wasn&rsquo;t taking the full horizontal force. I did try that, but it wasn&rsquo;t much better.)</p>
<p>I thought I could raise it up by tying the pole to the nearby tree - this tree is unfortunately still quite small else I&rsquo;d have used it in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/dea4e6af1b.jpg" alt="Oh Dear&hellip;" title="Oh Dear..."></p>
<p>A little too much force it seems&hellip;I took down the pole and ended up tying the antenna to the tree, whilst the tree is small it could still hold the weight of the line and I could get it moderately high. I ordered a space section, so the pole will be for a portable setup that I&rsquo;ll make one day.</p>
<p>The antenna is about 4m off the ground at the house end and almost 3 at the tree end. Not the greatest but will do. The closer it is to the ground the more signal is absorbed by the ground and the higher the remaining signal gets sent into the air. This isn&rsquo;t great for long distance as a lot of the signal will get lost or only do one bounce in the atmosphere. However, to get it higher I&rsquo;ll need some serious pole solution.</p>
<p>So how has it been? Pretty fun! I&rsquo;ve spoken to people all over Europe, into Canada and the USA. I can often hear signals from all around the world - Falklands, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, etc. - but they can&rsquo;t hear me.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4f5a932266.jpg" alt="Voice Contacts Made" title="Voice Contacts Made"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used the digital mode, FT8, which means I connect my computer to the radio and it communicates with other computers via radio. This doesn&rsquo;t need nearly as much signal compared to noise to make a contact compared to voice contacts. The best part is that you can look up online (on <a href="https://pskreporter.info/">PSK Reporter</a>) who has heard your signal. So you don&rsquo;t need to make a contact with them to know how far your signal has gone. I&rsquo;ve been heard across the world with this, and have made real contacts with Australia, Brazil and Japan.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3a99c21b17.jpg" alt="Who&rsquo;s heard me? The pins with times are who has" title="Who's heard me? The pins with times are who has"></p>
<p>Digital is nice to do whilst doing something else on the computer, and it is fun when you see someone far away has heard you, but by far the most fun is talking to people. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a quick signal report and move on, and other times we get into chats about gear (most often) and local things going on. Often I&rsquo;ll listen to others chatting and enjoy that just as much. Each evening you go on, you never know who&rsquo;s going to be there and who&rsquo;s going to hear you (the signal propagation relies on solar activity and is different each day on each band). I could (and have!) spend hours on the radio. So much so that I&rsquo;ve not had time to do anything else - no photography, no blog posts, not finished the mac mini G3 build, and probably plenty of other things.</p>
<p>I did manage to tear myself away from the radio to study for the intermediate licence - this is the next level in the UK system and lets me use 50W and a few more bands. I passed this a few weeks ago, and so have a new callsign, 2M0RVM. It takes a while to get used to saying the new sign and sometimes I mix up the old and new, especially the RVP vs RVM. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve picked something completely different but I liked the sound of RVM, and finding a free one is tricky, there isn&rsquo;t an up to date list anywhere (even the last freedom of information request list from January 2023 was significantly out of date).</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m debating the antenna situation. Pole or not, a vertical, something else. My wife isn&rsquo;t keen on the wire going across the garden but equally doesn&rsquo;t like the sound of a 10m pole! I have started to look into satellites too, at least a dish is more discrete. I&rsquo;m also thinking of setting up a portable antenna for trips away.</p>
<p>Plus I have the full licence still to get. 📚 (Update July 2023: I&rsquo;m now a full holder!)</p>

<p>Book cases, book shelves, whatever you call them, I am drawn towards them. It is always interesting to see what people put on theirs. Both the books and also the trinkets or sundries. It&rsquo;s such a big collection of stories, both contained within the book but of the person that owns them. What is the journey that this book has come along to get to this shelf? What did the reader think when they got the book, when (if) they read it? Where is the book going next?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky you have space, and shelves and books to together, and then you get to choose what goes on them, and where in the house these books should live. You get to pick the order in which they&rsquo;re stacked on the shelf.</p>
<p>Or maybe these decisions have never been made, and just the natural flow of life has resulted in books on shelves with the same choosing that results in driftwood on a beach.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/b3e6403ca9.jpg" alt="Kids books on the landing" title="Kids books on the landing"></p>
<p>Some books have obvious places to live. Kids books in or near kids rooms for bedtime stories, or for them to hide away from the world and enjoy the quiet company of a book.</p>
<p>Recipe books in the kitchen. Some carefully written down instructions past down through the family, some old favourites of chefs long retired, some modern and cool but totally impractical for busy family life.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/bdd1fd810b.jpg" alt="Kitchen bookshelf" title="Kitchen bookshelf"></p>
<p>I always enjoy looking at other people&rsquo;s bookcases, as a whole and at individual books. Always a good topic of conversation.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/563f4ee5b3.jpg" alt="Bedroom bookshelf" title="Bedroom bookshelf"></p>
<p>I have a lot of ebooks too. These are very convenient to take with me on holiday and great for reading at night in bed. I can read for hours in the dark with my backlit ebook reader and no-one else is disturbed. But no-one else will really read those books unless I actively tell them or they come asking. These books are hidden away, never to provide entertainment for a curious passerby.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/e506523c82.jpg" alt="Boys' bookshelf" title="Boys' bookshelf"></p>
<p>I suppose the next best thing to admiring books, is to actually read them. Maybe even write some thoughts down as you read them.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this up for the last 14 months! I also took a lot more photos for this post but I don&rsquo;t seem to be able to find any&hellip;🤷</p>
<p>A while back, in 2021, I was making a <a href="https://wiki.alexjj.com/#LargeFormat">wiki note</a> on large format cameras, specifically 4x5 cameras. Jack noticed this and asked me if I would be interested in his <a href="https://wiki.baty.net/#Burke%20&amp;%20James%20Press%20Camera">B&amp;J Press camera</a>. Very generous of him! Postage to the UK wasn&rsquo;t the cheapest, but it was still far cheaper than trying to find anything here.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3a9dc79ab1.jpg" alt="Burke and James Press Camera" title="Burke and James Press Camera"></p>
<p>This is a 4x5 camera, meaning it takes 4x5&quot; film. It just uses one sheet at a time and it is a VERY manual process! With so many steps from what you see to a photo, that if you get it right the sense of accomplishment is beyond words.</p>
<p>It took me a few months before I mustered up everything I needed, plus the commitment to actually use it. I got a box of Fomapan 400 sheets, loaded them into the film backs in my dark bag and proceeded to try and take a picture of <em>something</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/e949526aa8.jpg" alt="Camera on tripod" title="Make shift dark cloth"></p>
<p>I took it into the back garden and took some (two) photos of the house and then of the kids. Amazingly they stood still long enough for me to faff about and take the shot.</p>
<p>Up to this point, whilst I had been taking film photos, I&rsquo;d never developed anything myself and had just been sending off the film to labs. Now with 4x5 this is a lot harder as it&rsquo;s great big sheets that you can&rsquo;t expose to the light. I&rsquo;d have to post off the whole holder, and that did not seem very reliable, plus the cost was tremendous. So as well as doing my first 4x5, I was also doing my first home development&hellip;in trays!</p>
<p>I set it all up in the bathroom in the spare room, it has no windows and I thought it would be a good location. All the trays were filled and I was ready to develop. It&rsquo;s quite strange (and very uncomfortable) sitting on the floor for 20 minutes whilst trying to develop these sheets. I also realised that, after adjusting the the darkness for 20 minutes, that the room wasn&rsquo;t as dark as I thought it was. Oh well.</p>
<p>By some miracle of beginners luck I did manage to make a photo!</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/f6039014b4.jpg" alt="Kids black and white photo" title="That vintage look"></p>
<p>Technically, it is absolutely terrible, and look at all those scratches and uneven developing marks. However, I love it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it would end up being the only successful photo I&rsquo;ve managed to make with the B&amp;J. I tried it again and everything was black. Somewhere, something is leaking light and I&rsquo;d need to do a lot of investigating to figure out exactly what is the problem. Is the film I bought sealed from the light? Is it the film holder? Is it the camera? Did I develop it correctly? And maybe some others. I did buy a special developing tank for the 4x5 to make it less painful to develop.</p>
<p>So for the past 14 months, the B&amp;J has made a nice shelf decoration with my camera things. I enjoyed using it, and I&rsquo;d like to do it again, but maybe when I have more time. It&rsquo;s definitely one for the retired/kids have left home timeframe!</p>

			 <p>Annual recaps seem to be the trend in social media and apps. It&rsquo;s quite interesting actually. Reddit did one, which told me the scary number of hours I&rsquo;ve spent on the app. Including spending 25 hours on /r/leica 🤫</p>
<p>Steam now do one and shows me how much time I spend on games. I knew I didn&rsquo;t play that much but I was surprised by how little I did actually play!</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/f952ccd036.jpg" alt="" title="Doesn't actually compute time"></p>
<p>I played Black Mesa, the Half-Life 1 remake in the HL2 engine, in March this year for just shy of 20 hours. My friend and I played Grim Dawn, think Diablo 2, in August and September for about 15 hours. We also played Streets of Rage 4, a remake of the Sega classics from the 90s. This was a disappointingly short game at 3.6 hours. It was fun but I&rsquo;m sure the originals were much longer. That, or we just used to play them endlessly as penniless kids.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to play Horizon Zero Dawn a couple of times. Not sure why I&rsquo;ve not got into it properly. It&rsquo;s a nice RPG story game, but seems to have a unique storyline which looks interesting. It&rsquo;s quite old now, and so often goes on sale. I picked it up at the start of the year but didn&rsquo;t properly play it until June (if you count 3 hours as properly). I think that was a bit before our summer holidays and so when I came back I&rsquo;d forgotten the controls and what was happening so didn&rsquo;t continue. Then the longer I left it the harder it was to restart. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it recently but yet to start.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/7f274629b7.jpg" alt="" title="Not much since March"></p>
<p>I actually want to play more games in 2023. I enjoy playing them and it&rsquo;s a good way to relax if I&rsquo;m tired from work. Feels like a better use of time than randomly browsing the internet, or spending another 25 hours on certain subreddits!</p>
<p>To finish the year, I&rsquo;ve been playing Dwarf Fortress. I&rsquo;ve been playing this game for years&hellip;I don&rsquo;t remember exactly when I found it, but I think around 2011. It&rsquo;s been free forever on their <a href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">website</a>, but they just released a version on Steam this month. It has a new UI and a little bit more approachable. I&rsquo;ve you&rsquo;ve not heard of it then you&rsquo;re missing out on some internet game lore. It&rsquo;s a game made by two brothers that they started in 2002. They have been making this game as their full time job since then (or maybe about 2006) and living off donations. It is a simulation game and is detailed beyond anything ever. At the same time the original graphics are just ASCII characters. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress">Wikipedia</a> can do a better job of explaining it than me.</p>
<p>I bought the Steam version, partly to support them and partly because it has a new UI. With christmas and everything I&rsquo;ve not played much, about 8 hours, but it&rsquo;s one I plan to continue into the new year.</p>

			 <p>This post sat as a draft for a long time when I was using blot. Whilst migrating my site to this new Hugo one I saw the pictures I took and thought I might as well write it up quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/92dfcdf80f.jpg" alt="Two fuji lenses" title="Side by side"></p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I ended up with both the 50mm f/2 and the 60mm f/2.4. The first as I wanted a longer lens for when out and about, but still light and quick focusing, and the latter as I started scanning my film with my camera. One day I decided that having both was unnecessary and I went about deciding which one to get rid of.</p>
<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/7ae69bbcb4.jpg" alt="Two lenses with hoods" title="What a big hood you have"></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both similar in size and weight, except when you put the massive metal hood on the 60 mm, which adds another 70g, 30% weight of the lens itself! The 60mm must flare badly if it has such a stonking great hood. Does mean you don&rsquo;t always need to carry it with you.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/549f5ac306.jpg" alt="50mm on scales" title="Lightweight 50mm">
<img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/1467c8edb9.jpg" alt="60mm on scales" title="That hood"></p>
<p>Being 60mm, you do get more subject separation than the 50mm, even with the fraction slower speed. So for portraits - where people are standing still - the 60mm is probably better. It&rsquo;s also of the old, original set of Fuji lenses (along with the <a href="/2022/new-fuji-lens/">35mm f/1.4</a> and the 56 f/1.2), which means it has a slightly different look than the modern ones. Good or bad? That&rsquo;s personal preference. I certainly like the 35mm one.</p>
<p>f/2.4 vs f/2 is not really much different, although I&rsquo;ve not done sharpness tests etc., for that you&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>The obvious difference is that the 60mm has close focus for macro - this was the very reason I bought it. I&rsquo;m not sure 60mm is a great macro length and it&rsquo;s not a perfect 1:1 macro, so YMMV. I&rsquo;m thinking about replacing mine as for film scanning I can&rsquo;t make use of the full sensor area with this lens, so seems like a waste.</p>
<p>Speaking of focusing&hellip;oh my, how the 60mm is slow compared to the 50mm. It&rsquo;s not super slow, and perfectly usable even for kids running around but it&rsquo;s not the 🫰 and you&rsquo;re there focus of the 50mm. Having said that, the 50mm often missed focus on kids running around so not perfect either.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I sold the 50mm and kept the 60mm. I need the macro (unless I change my mind on the camera scanning solution) and I don&rsquo;t often like shooting at longer lengths and I rarely/never do portrait sessions, so the 50mm doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. Plus if I did do portraits, I could use the 60mm and it would be fine.</p>
<p>I actually have the 60mm for sale, with the intent to replace it with a better macro. There are various 3rd party manual focus macros which are much better and would be ideal for film scanning. Although I&rsquo;m also tempted to abandon film scanning with my camera and just buy a dedicated 35mm scanner like the Plusteks. I used to own one but sold it and now I regret that. Whilst they&rsquo;re slow to scan, everything is right there and easy to do. If the 60mm ever sells then I&rsquo;ll decide what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A few weeks ago I managed my first successful attempt at film development. Whilst I was very excited that it worked, the next thing was actually seeing the images. I did take a tiny picture of several frames using my phone and the filmdev app. That was fun just to see that there was something.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/cb473e07ac.jpg" alt="Quick scan with phone" title="Quick scan with phone"></p>
<p>The next thing is making larger images. My two choices were scanning onto the computer or dark room printing. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t have a darkroom (although I do want to somehow make one in the garage), so scanning it is. When I scanned my grandfather&rsquo;s slides I used a dedicated 35mm/slide scanner. The Plustek 8200 or something, together with Silverfast AI. The scanner is slow, the software is very weird, but once you figured out the routine you could steadily work your way through them all. In my wisdom, I&rsquo;d sold the Plustek after finishing the slides - actually made money on it, which when I then came to look at buying another realised that this is because the prices are going up, and still going up, for used models. Another option is a flatbed scanner, but those are quite expensive and sounded more annoying for 35mm.</p>
<p>The final option is using a digital camera. As I have a digital camera, this did seem the more sensible option. However, you do need quite a few other things to make it all work. Namely a tripod or stand, light source, macro lens, and something to hold the film/black out around it. Like all things you can spend a fortune on any one of these items. I tried not to but the macro lens was never going to be cheap. I went for the Fuji 60mm f/2.4 as I thought it would also be useful as a mid-range portrait lens. I&rsquo;ve never used it for that but I still might. However, having used it for scanning I&rsquo;m not sure I like it for that. I&rsquo;ve found manual focus is more reliable and helps speed up the process once it&rsquo;s dialled in and the 60mm&rsquo;s focus by wire isn&rsquo;t that great. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll look to sell it and get a manual focus one - assuming it&rsquo;s a net cost to me.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/03ed475389.jpg" alt="First attempts with a terrible tripod" title="First attempts with a terrible tripod"></p>
<p>Back when I did my first development on 4x5, I tried a cheapo camera stand thing and a home made, black card mask. The mask was actually fine but the  tripod stand thing was absolutely terrible. Wobbly and hard to adjust. It went straight back and I shelled out for a reasonable tripod. I had to find one that let me rotate the pole around so the camera can be mounted underneath. This is much more stable, secure and makes it easy to keep things parallel. For 35mm I think a home made mask might get tedious, so I went with an <a href="https://clifforth.co.uk/">essential film holder</a>. This gets lots of great reviews online, and as far as holders go it&rsquo;s a cheap one - although still £75&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/1e7bfeecae.jpg" alt="A much nicer tripod and film holder" title="A much nicer tripod and film holder"></p>
<p>The fold out screen of the X-E4 is very handy for lining stuff up and changing settings. It flips the display when the screen moves past a certain angle which is ideal, it does mean the menu navigation is backwards but I can get used to that. I should make a preset for scanning so that I can get going quicker next time, as changing settings is a bit of a hassle as I then have to change them back later. I think I&rsquo;ve messed up one of my presets so I&rsquo;ll have to check that next time I&rsquo;m using the camera. The macro lens isn&rsquo;t quite long enough to get the film to completely fill the screen/sensor, extension tubes could fix that, or a longer lens. Maybe 80mm or 100mm? It&rsquo;s not too big a deal as I just crop in post, which I&rsquo;d do anyway. It also makes it quick to align as I&rsquo;m not trying to hit it perfect straight away. Probably means my images are 12-14 megapixel vs. the cameras 26. Still plenty big enough.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/a05203f190.jpg" alt="Camera close up" title="Camera close up"></p>
<p>I spent a lot of time faffing about with trying to do tethered photos with Lightroom on the computer. Eventually realised that my copy of lightroom needs a paid for add-on to do it with Fuji. I then tried Fuji&rsquo;s X Acquire but I couldn&rsquo;t get it to work. The instructions said to put the camera in a certain mode, but my settings didn&rsquo;t have that option, only for a webcam, so I don&rsquo;t know. I also tried using the remote app on my phone but it was too slow and awkward for focusing. I was concerned about camera shake, but I just ended up using the 2 second delay to take the photos. This worked well, except it makes a really loud beeping sound which annoyed my wife in the other room whilst she was watching TV!</p>
<p>Just to add to it all, my battery was very low and all the fiddling around I&rsquo;d been doing meant it died after a few shots.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/40f5706068.jpg" alt="The starting point" title="The starting point"></p>
<p>Once I got the first image in focus with peaking and zooming it, I could quite quickly move between frames and capture the whole roll in not much time at all. I think with a scanning preset setup on the camera, next time should be very quick.</p>
<p>I then spent ages fighting with Lightroom again until I realised my copy, again, was too old and didn&rsquo;t support my camera&rsquo;s raw files. So that was the end of Lightroom. When I went to bed that night I realised I could use another program to convert the RAFs to DNGs and use Lightroom.</p>
<p>I have a copy of Capture One Express for Fujifilm, so I thought I&rsquo;d try that out, as all the negatives are, well, negative, I need to invert them and crop them at a minimum before I have useable images. C1ex seems a little buggy as it would crash when I&rsquo;d try and customise the menu bars but I soon found my groove with it. Probably all photo editors can do it, but copying and pasting settings, and everything having a keyboard shortcut made editing (once I got the hang of it), very quick. I probably spent 20 minutes on the first two images, and then 10 on the other 26. (I seem to only have 28 from my 36 roll 😕)</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/a610538d41.jpg" alt="Flip the curve" title="Flip the curve"></p>
<p>There are loads of film conversion tools out there and it&rsquo;s overwhelming. Either as standalone things or plugins to various programs - typically Lightroom, or Photoshop. Negative Lab Pro seems to be the most common/popular one, it&rsquo;s for LrC, but given all my heartache with Lightroom, I&rsquo;ve not tried it yet. I think these plugins are probably most useful for colour negatives. Black and white is fairly easy. The common method of &ldquo;flipping the curve&rdquo;, i.e. move the ends of the line to the opposite of where they start, does the job. I then cropped out the blank area, and film edges, hit auto, tweaked a few things like exposure and blacks/whites and the image is good to go! Then paste the settings to the rest and crop them.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/c97ca67710.jpg" alt="The final output" title="The final output"></p>
<p>I later found moving saturation all the way to zero ensured my images were black and white and didn&rsquo;t have some blue tinge from the white balance setting. Usually auto was fine, but sometimes I had to use the white balance picker to find a suitable white part to get it right. I did scan all the images upside down, so next time I can fix that.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pleased with the results, and it&rsquo;s nice to have done the whole thing from exposing the photo, developing the film to scanning and processing it myself. Now that I&rsquo;ve done it once, and know what I&rsquo;m doing, and together with some pre-configuration of camera and setup, I think the next roll will be pretty quick to do. As long as I&rsquo;ve charged the battery first!</p>

			 <p>My dad likes photography, but he doesn&rsquo;t really have a camera. He used to own one, think it was a Praktica SLR. He&rsquo;s told me the story of dropping it in the sand at a beach and also of setting up a darkroom space in his bathroom, but then never getting a chance to use it before moving. Having said he likes photography, I&rsquo;m not really sure how many photos he&rsquo;s taken. Not the exact number, but whether it&rsquo;s been a consistent thing over time. He gave the SLR to my sister - not that I think she&rsquo;s used it - and I&rsquo;m not sure if he has any digital camera other than his phone.</p>
<p>This is the issue though, would he want something beyond his phone? He also doesn&rsquo;t have a computer, just an iPad, and I feel like photography on an iPad, whilst doable, is not that enjoyable, particularly if you&rsquo;re not up for &ldquo;a routine&rdquo; to make it all work.</p>
<p>So why am I looking for a camera for my dad? Mostly because I think he&rsquo;d like it. He likes birds and gets a lot of wildlife in his garden. He also lives in the countryside with lots of good walks. There&rsquo;s lots of scope for wildlife and landscapes, although I feel like he&rsquo;d want to focus on birds.</p>
<p>The most obvious choice is a digital with super zoom. Maybe APS-C to get some reach, or even MFT as I see a lot of bird photos with them on reddit. I don&rsquo;t really want to spend a huge amount - I had thought about asking my sisters if they want to split it with me for his Christmas, but that probably wouldn&rsquo;t add that much. This then leads to used cameras, and maybe something like a Nikon D90, and a Tameron lens. However, something exactly like a D90 ends up being a lot more expensive than you think. I think as it&rsquo;s well known and then it&rsquo;s quite popular and that keeps the price high.</p>
<p>Whilst I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much money, I also don&rsquo;t want it to be a terrible camera and then be annoying to use.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m partially tempted to get a film SLR and a long lens, mostly as it&rsquo;s quite straight forward to use, the film gets developed and then there&rsquo;s no digital media to deal with. Not that he couldn&rsquo;t deal with it but it would simplify stuff. However, maybe I&rsquo;m just projecting my enjoyment of film on to others&hellip;</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a very in-depth assessment at possible options, and writing it mostly made me wonder if he really would actually like a camera or not. I&rsquo;m leaning towards no and so, whilst I do enjoy a good research project, it seems like a waste of time. He&rsquo;s had cameras, they have digital cameras in the house that belong to my sisters that he could&rsquo;ve easily borrowed. Maybe getting one as a present would change his mindset, but I feel like he is too busy to start another hobby.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real outcome is asking him about it.</p>

<p>This, the 35mm f/1.4, just arrived today from eBay. I fitted it to my X-E4 and took a selfie in front of the mirror. It&rsquo;s night time so it&rsquo;s dark and I decided just to focus on the camera not my tired eyes. I can&rsquo;t believe how light this lens is, even with the hood on. It&rsquo;s lighter than my 50mm f/2. It&rsquo;s quite long, particularly with the hood but because of its lightness it balances nicely on the X-E4. Aesthetically, the 18mm looks better on the X-E4 - like a mini-Q2!</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/bf3dc50455.jpg" alt="Quite a deep lens, particularly with hood" title="Quite a deep lens, particularly with hood"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m listing my 50 f/2 this weekend, and so I&rsquo;ve justified this new lens to myself as it&rsquo;ll be a swap. The 50mm is nice but a little boring and whilst I try and take it out with me, I find it&rsquo;s a little too long most of the time. The 35mm, or 50mm eq., is a much more useful focal length for me. Perhaps it&rsquo;s a little excessive as now I have the 18, 23, 27, and 35 primes, and they&rsquo;re all so close to each other. I still think they all have a specific purpose, driven by their physical size, aperture and focal length, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d sell any of them just yet.</p>
<p>35mm on APS-C used to be my go to length for years. I had a Nikon 35mm f/1.8 for my D40/7000/7200. It was perfect and I enjoyed using it a lot. When I moved to Fuji and the X100F I was at 23mm. As that was my only camera, I didn&rsquo;t have a choice but I have come to like 23mm (or 35mm eq.) focal length. When I moved to the X-T2, the 23mm f/1.4 was my second prime, right after the 35mm f/2. The first lens I bought for my M2 was the 35mm. I do have a 90mm for it but again, like the Fuji 50, it&rsquo;s a little too long for every day usage.</p>
<p>Back to the Fuji, and even with the extra weight and size the 23mm was my go to lens. I later sold the 35mm f/2 as I found I didn&rsquo;t use it. When I was first looking for a lens for my X-T2, I did consider the 35mm f/1.4 for a long time. I ended up not picking it as everyone said it was slow autofocusing and it was more expensive. It is the older style, original lenses from Fujifilm and it does have a slower and noisier autofocus, but it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> slow.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/5acd221488.jpg" alt="Long nosed Q" title="Long nosed Q"></p>
<p>The internet talks a lot about this lens, and how it has special qualities and a unique look. I don&rsquo;t know about that, but portraits at 1.4 do have a little edge over f/2. I&rsquo;m looking forward to capturing everyone with it and seeing if I can see that special look. I&rsquo;ll probably never see it, but if I make pleasing images with it then that&rsquo;ll do me.</p>
<p>Plus when I get bored of it, and realise I have too many primes within 5mm of each other, I can just sell it and probably not lose much if anything.</p>

They offer good performance at a good price, and generally there are loads of them available. They&rsquo;re typically ex-business machines and have enjoyed a comfy life in an office. They usually have good CPUs and if you&rsquo;re lucky you can get decent ram and SSDs in them already. Being for businesses they tend to have great accessibility to the insides, often being designed nicely to access bays or replace parts. They often have nice hard drive bays, perfectly sized cables tucked in just right, and they often have specific power supplies that are compact, and efficient. Some of them only make 12V which makes them really efficient. Cooling is usually well thought out, and with nice ducting and rubber grommeted fans to keep vibrations low.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say if you&rsquo;re looking for a general purpose machine, either desktop or server, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with some line of these machines. There are a lot of models and series over the years. Price reflects this but with some research, or just filtering by CPU you can find what you need. Modern CPUs are ridiculously powerful and will be fine for many years.</p>
<p>If you go for recent models, like 10th gen intel, then the power draw by these machines is tiny on idle, but then you still get a 8 or more threaded CPU when you do hit the gas.  These machines often come in multiple sizes, from tiny chassis up to basically full size towers. Space and expansion obviously aligns with the size, but if you just need laptop innards but in a desktop then the tiny models are great. If size is a concern then the tiny or not-quite-so-tiny desktop models may be a great selling point for you. Like a NUC but without the premium price tag to go with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/8d49648891.jpg" alt="Well organised inside" title="Well organised inside"></p>
<p>So why wouldn&rsquo;t you buy one? Generally these are designed for businesses and as such graphics performance tends to be poor for gaming or ML /GPU intensive work. That&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t get models with GPUs or larger cases have space for them, but then the power supply tends not to be sufficient. Expansion of these machines tends to be quite limited. This is of course dependant on your perspective. As you can still get 64GB of ram and 1-3 storage devices (NVME, SSD, HDD), and a PCI-E expansion card (depending on the model). So be sure to know what you want before you buy it, as it&rsquo;s not as flexible as a regular desktop. Little things like using special power supply connectors on the motherboard means you can&rsquo;t put in a new PSU to enable running a bigger GPU, or some SATA slots are weirdly slow as they&rsquo;re only meant for DVD drives. There aren&rsquo;t extra SATA power cables for another drive, even if you could stick it somewhere.  The motherboard is a weird shape or size, so you would struggle to move it into a regular case - because you wanted to expand it.</p>

<p>If something fails then it might mean the whole computer is done. If you&rsquo;re lucky there are parts on ebay or somewhere. This is probably just the motherboard and PSU, with PSU being the most annoying if it failed.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My experience</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve owned 3-4 of these over the years and they&rsquo;ve all been great. Again, that price vs. performance is hard to beat. You get everything for the same price as maybe buying a motherboard and CPU - even used parts. I think the older ones were generally more compatible, and the newer ones have more proprietary connections and designs. However, if you research them carefully (they all have maintenance manuals online) and get what you need, I see no reason not to get one.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4ac9c81394.jpg" alt="Easy access design" title="Easy access design"></p>
<p>My latest one is a HP ProDesk 400 G7. It has a 10th gen intel i5, and came with an 8GB stick and a 256GB NVME. It&rsquo;s the small form factor (SFF) so has a 1x and 16x PCI-e slot, and has space for 2x 2.5&quot; drives, or 1x 3.5&quot;. Currently it has a DVD (maybe writer) in the slot. I wanted a new server that was lower powered when on idle, and a newer intel CPU to take advantage of the Quicksync transcoding feature for plex. There are multiple G series, one for each intel gen. The price for the G7 seemed worth it to me. According to the manual it should idle at about 5W (pre-any drives I assume),</p>
<p>This is replacing a previous prebuilt of the Lenovo TS-140. I actually bought that new as there was a really good cashback offer on it, which made it a fraction of the price. Maybe even $150 or something. This came with a 4th gen i3 but I upgraded it to a Xeon 1246 v3. It has served me well, and is still perfectly fine, however, it idles at 50W and can&rsquo;t do h265 natively. It does, however, have space for 4x 3.5&quot; drives (with a bit of an adapter in the 5.25&quot; bays).</p>
<p>I currently have 4x 4TB WD Red drives in a ZFS RAIDZ1 array, so usable storage of about 12 TB. I don&rsquo;t need 12 TB, although I have used a lot. We&rsquo;ve tried to tidy up but there are a lot of old movies that we had on DVD or even VHS that we&rsquo;ve kept. Many don&rsquo;t get watched but it&rsquo;s hard to part with them. So perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have got a machine that can only house one drive&hellip;.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/2cb777c582.jpg" alt="Buying used has some risk 🧹" title="Buying used has some risk 🧹"></p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m thinking that I could just get one drive for the new server and have everything on that. I&rsquo;ll keep my existing drives, either in the current computer or maybe look for a cheap 4 bay housing thing (tbh the current computer is probably the most sensible option other than it takes up more space) and use it as a pure NAS that turns on ~once a week for backups.</p>
<p>With the price of power going through the roof, I&rsquo;ve been driven by power consumption. It does come with trade offs but I tend to find that I can easily live within constraints when they occur, and is in fact a better approach than designing for all eventualities. Although I&rsquo;m still guilty of fixing things that aren&rsquo;t broke!</p>

			 <p>After the previous attempt, where I concluded the developer had expired, I was determined to continue. First I had to purchase some new developer. I decided to go for Kodak HC-110. This appears to be a classic developer from the beginning of time and it&rsquo;s high dilution ratio and long shelf life attracted me to it. Initially, I thought it was more expensive than the Ilford ilfosol 3, but that&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t notice I was buying 1 litre of HC-110 vs. the 500 ml of ilfosol (the pictures are the same size on the website 😅), and even with that obvious difference the dilution means the HC-110 wins out. I also took the opportunity to get some photoflo - this helps avoid water marks. Hydrophobic solution or some such. I found water marks and drying a pain when doing 4x5. The 35mm is a lot smaller but one less thing to deal with is always nice. The HC-110 does have a lot of warning labels on it, much more so than the Ilford. Perhaps that&rsquo;s just for the US market or perhaps it really is much worse for the environment? The whole development process does seem to be not great for the environment, I feel like I use a <strong>lot</strong> of water. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s ways to improve this and I&rsquo;ll look into it more.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/0e1e9e080c.jpg" alt="New chemicals" title="New chemicals"></p>
<p>Last time I had to figure out how to open the canister without a fancy tool, and so this time I got straight in and ripped it open like a hungry bear opening a dumpster lid. However, this time it took me <em>forever</em> to get the film onto the plastic development spool. Literally 45 minutes. I was tucked into my dark bag, absolutely sweating, fiddling about trying to get it on and to take. Once it did go but then seem to get stuck half way and wouldn&rsquo;t go any further. I had to then unwind it and start all over again 😢. My wife was out and I daren&rsquo;t take my arms out of the dark bag whilst the film was completely exposed inside, and I was wishing I&rsquo;d setup my iPad or phone next to me so I could try and get Siri to start playing a video of loading a spool. But then somehow it just worked. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, the last little bit didn&rsquo;t quite seem to go on, and so I tucked it in myself. Phew&hellip;all loaded, and now I could start the actual development! Seems like not perfectly dry plastic spools can have this issue. Although does make me interested in <a href="https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/products/lab-box-the-35mm-daylight-loading-film-tank">stuff like this</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1SGQQwNXQ">Video explainer.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made a <a href="/notes/film">permanent place now</a> to write my instructions so I won&rsquo;t forget, but doing it in practice is quite different from reading about it. I used a tiny measuring cylinder for the HC-110, but then rinsing the developer into the larger measuring cylinder was a bit of a hassle, I might use a syringe next time. I&rsquo;d made up all the stocks. I am using a stop chemical - people tell me they just use water, and probably I will in the future - but as I have it and it&rsquo;s getting a bit old I might as well use it up. I&rsquo;d bought some new fixer as well. The Ilford one I have as expired according to the label and so I didn&rsquo;t want something else ruining it. The Adox one gives you a choice of dilution and seemingly it just means you wait longer&hellip;so why wouldn&rsquo;t I go for the more dilute one?</p>
<p>The stop and the developer are both this pale yellow colour when made up, and I&rsquo;d placed them in the order I&rsquo;d use them on the side of the sink. I&rsquo;d also put a thermometer into the developer to stir it and see what the temperature was - seems our utility is a bit colder than the rest of the house and was only at 18 °C. However, what I hadn&rsquo;t noticed was that my labelled measuring cylinders were the wrong way round - I have one I&rsquo;ve written &lsquo;dev&rsquo; on and one with &lsquo;stop&rsquo; on (also one with &lsquo;fix&rsquo;). I&rsquo;d made up the solution into the wrong one! Not a super big deal but after I&rsquo;d poured in the developer I noticed and then that got me doubting I knew exactly which was which! If I was really worried, I could&rsquo;ve poured it out, washed a lot and then started again. However, I was fairly confident because of the thermometer&hellip;</p>
<p>Time past, agitation was applied, and then the gallons of water was washed over the film. I dipped the spool in the photoflo (that&rsquo;ll last ages as 200:1 dilution! aka a drop), and then lifted it out to see what happened&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/7bb4e748b0.jpg" alt="Success!" title="Success!"></p>
<p>I was overjoyed to see the development had worked. No blank or black or something film, just lovely little 35mm frames all the way along. In my excitement I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to how I was cutting them up, and instead of strips of 6 it was all over the place with 4, 6, 8&hellip;all sorts! The photoflo seemed to work well as the water just ran right off them whilst hanging up to dry.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4779836024.jpg" alt="Drying nicely" title="Drying nicely"></p>
<p>So that was yesterday, and by the time it was all done, it was time for bed! Now the next mammoth effort, which is scanning them in. I think I have everything I need, although still deciding upon what software to use. Everyone seems to love negative lab pro, and I&rsquo;ve downloaded the free trial to test it out. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s another $100 on something. All this stuff&hellip;there are lots of free things, or just instructions for Lightroom, and the open source editors like GIMP or Darktable all do it to some degree. What I would really like to do is make a contact sheet, just so I can look at them quickly and see what&rsquo;s what. I had a quick mess about with the Film Dev app on iOS and laying a couple of strips on my light box. That actually works out pretty well just to see what you have. I could do with a holder or a transparent storage sleeve to hold them in. Annoyingly I just bought some 35mm storage sleeves two days ago, but I&rsquo;d just gone for ones with opaque tracing paper style back, mostly as that&rsquo;s what came up first and I have them already from films done by the lab. Now I see there are just as many transparent ones, which are probably more useful to have in the long run for going back through all photos. Even more annoyingly is that they went up in price on Amazon TODAY! Only a couple of quid, but still it&rsquo;s yet another thing to buy 😅. Here&rsquo;s the quick shot I did, mostly pick the strips at random but I quite like the four slide montage of individuals.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/bd403ac86b.jpg" alt="Quick scan with phone"></p>
<p>It was quite an ordeal but makes the photos all the more enjoyable. All in all, I&rsquo;m very happy with it. I&rsquo;ll get to scanning them all at some point but I&rsquo;m happy not to send B&amp;W away to the lab now (although I still will for colour). Am I now going to be 100% film, and blasting through multiple rolls a day&hellip;probably not, but now I won&rsquo;t think quite so hard as to whether whatever we&rsquo;re doing is enough to justify a roll of film.</p>

			 <p>This isn&rsquo;t my first attempt at film development, that was at the beginning of this year with trying out the 4x5 camera. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about that for 9 months, maybe I&rsquo;ll get to it soon&hellip; This was my first attempt at 35mm film though (black and white, obviously). Up to now I&rsquo;ve just sent them away to filmdev.co.uk as they do a good job and are competitively priced. Although prices have gone up this year, so not quite as cheap as it used to be. I have thought of using them just for development and then scanning myself to save some money, but why not do the whole thing!</p>
<p>::: {.callout-note title=&ldquo;tl;dr&rdquo;}
It went badly.
:::</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had all the stuff since last Christmas when I asked for it from family members - as no-one ever knows what to get for me. Although I don&rsquo;t have a film canister opener. I did try using a bottle opener but it didn&rsquo;t really work. I ended up just ripping the canister apart from the film leader gap. That worked quite well as I could hold the coiled film.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/f976f19fcd.jpg" alt="Let&rsquo;s do this!" title="Let's do this!"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a dark room, just a dark bag - as you can see - and loading the film into the spool was interesting. I was wearing some gloves to try and stop getting too much finger grease on the film but it was impossible to feel the film and the entrance to the spool. I ended up taking off one glove and then I could feel it better and feed it on to the spool. Once on, it&rsquo;s easy to roll as you just turn the spool back and forth and it loads. It was surprisingly easy to do. I put it into the developing tank. The one I have can hold two spools but I thought I&rsquo;d just try wrecking one film first (a good choice). I should&rsquo;ve put it on the bottom of the tank and the blank on top to minimise the amount of chemicals I need, but I didn&rsquo;t think about it at the time and just put it on the top to make it easier to load.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3809cdc9aa.jpg" alt="Need some tea after that strenuous work" title="Need some tea after that strenuous work"></p>
<p>All ready to develop! It&rsquo;s been 9 months since I last did it, and I realised I had forgotten most of what I needed to do. Some googling and I was all set. I had made some notes on what I did but I have no idea where I saved those as I couldn&rsquo;t find them. I&rsquo;ve since made a <a href="/film">cheatsheet page on this site</a> so I can find it in the future!</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/c20630e094.jpg" alt="Chemicals a-ready" title="Chemicals a-ready"></p>
<p>At this stage I should&rsquo;ve realised something wasn&rsquo;t quite right. See that dark red solution? That&rsquo;s the developer. I need to find my photo of my first development efforts, but as I was pouring it I did think it looked awfully dark. However, I did nothing and carried on regardless. My sister was staying at the time and she came to see what I was up to. She walked in to me saying &ldquo;1 to 9; 450 ml&rdquo; as I was trying to figure out the dilution ratios. Maybe it&rsquo;s me but I dislike ratios. Just make it a decimal. 🤓</p>
<p>::: {.column-margin}
I assume the issue was dodgy developer but perhaps there was something else too?
:::</p>
<p>I use the Dev It app on my phone to manage the stages and times. I works pretty well and you can look up what others have used for the same film and solutions. After the developing, stopping, fixing, washing, agitating and timing, I was ready&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/0f76cb130f.jpg" alt="Well this doesn&rsquo;t look good." title="Well this doesn't look good."></p>
<p>My sister looks at it and says: &ldquo;is that what it&rsquo;s supposed to be like?&rdquo;. COMPLETELY BLANK. lolnope. We laugh a lot. 😂 Then I sighed. None of the pictures were anything special or particular, just the kids and us playing and out and about, but I was looking forward to seeing them. Well another lesson taught with brutal honesty by film</p>
<p>Side story:</p>
<p>At university, I did natural sciences in the first year and one of those was physics. We had labs each week and at some stage we were doing optics, and the lab involved taking photos with a film camera. This was back when I had no idea about anything and just used a point and shoot the whole time. Anyway, I spent 3 hours doing the lab. Setting up things to photograph, changing the distance and aperture etc. I took the whole roll and went into the darkroom. Thinking about it now it seems wild we were just left to get on with the film development with just a piece of paper to explain. After all of that I take out my film and it looks remarkably like the blank one above. Turns out I hadn&rsquo;t loaded it properly and it never wound on. 😢 The moment I took out this film I was reminded of that lab, one afternoon  nearly 20 years ago. This time I know the film wound on, as the M2 has the rewind knob with the two red dots that turn and I reached the end as I couldn&rsquo;t advance the film.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/b10a04ff88.jpg" alt="Compared to a properly developed roll of HP5+" title="Compared to a properly developed roll of HP5+"></p>
<p>As part of my investigation into why, I got out another roll of HP5 that had been developed. I noticed the leader was perfectly black and the edges have some darkness on it. My film was perfectly clear the whole way. So that can&rsquo;t be right as the leader had also been expose to the daylight. This suggested chemicals was the problem not the camera or loading etc. I get on the signal chat and ask my film development <a href="https://baty.net/">support team</a>. Dodgy developer was the main suspect.</p>
<p>I then take a look at the bottle of developer:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/first-35mm-film-development/first-35mm-dev-6.jpg" alt="Read the instructions" title="Read the instructions"></p>
<p>This bottle was opened New Year&rsquo;s Day 2022. Further forum reading suggests darkening is another symptom, particularly bad if it looks like strong tea.</p>
<p>Now strong tea is something I can recognise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve ordered some new chemical. Going with Kodak HC-110 this time. It keeps longer and is more economical per roll too, so that&rsquo;s a bonus. I need to take some pictures and then give it another go. Hopefully third time&rsquo;s the charm. Then I can enjoy the other eight rolls of HP5+ I&rsquo;ve got waiting.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I was passing through London and thought I&rsquo;d take the opportunity to visit the flagship Leica store of the UK - London Mayfair. If you&rsquo;ve played Monopoly, you&rsquo;ll know this is the expensive part of town!</p>
<p>It was quite the store. Display cabinets with all the cameras and lenses - M, SL, Q. There was a gallery and various display cabinets. I could&rsquo;ve spent hours there, but unfortunately I only had about 20 minutes between trains.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out the M10, and I asked the white T-shirt&rsquo;d hipster looking attendant if they had any I could try out. They only had a display M10-R as supposedly everything else was back at Wetzlar being looked over. I tried it with the 35mm summilux that was attached to it when he brought it out and then with the 90mm tele-elmarit I had with me. It felt exactly like holding the M2, it was unreal. The viewfinder was so bright and clear. It was lovely, and at that moment I was convinced I needed to get one.</p>
<p>But when I got home, and looked at the prices, that certainty started to dissolve.</p>

			 <p>The Queen is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62862148">travelling</a> from Balmoral Castle to Edinburgh, and goes along the main road that&rsquo;s a 10 minute walk from our house. Couldn&rsquo;t really be easier to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4e9af4fba2.jpg" alt="A big crowd" title="A big crowd"></p>
<p>There were, unsurprisingly, a lot of people. There were also a lot of police stationed every 100 metres or so just to keep people on the pavements. The road wasn&rsquo;t closed the whole time, and so people were still trying to drive around but it would&rsquo;ve been a nightmare.</p>

<p>We could see the TV helicopter in the air and used that to guess when they were getting near. A whole procession of police bikes, vans, and cars all came by first. Then the Queen, and then the Royal Bentley with the Princess Royal and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. They weren&rsquo;t going that slowly at our section and it was over in a flash. If you&rsquo;d turned away you&rsquo;d have missed it! A huge number of Range Rovers and other vehicles, police, ambulance and others all followed.</p>

<p>I was going to call this a review but it&rsquo;s not that official. Kosmo Foto Mono is a 100-ISO panchromatic black-and-white film. I think I bought it as I liked the box design more than any meticulous research that I undertook. I think it&rsquo;s made by Fomapan, but I think it&rsquo;s quite different to the Fomapan line. They suggest you can pull it to 50 and push it to 400, which I think is unusal for a panchromatic film. I&rsquo;ve not pushed it myself, and I shot it at the box 100 speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/Kosmos-film-review/kosmos-1.jpg" alt="The photo that attracts the most remarks" title="The photo that attracts the most remarks"></p>
<p>As I said, I bought it mostly on a whim, I think I was just picking a random selection of things to try out. It might&rsquo;ve been on sale too. I took it with me in the M2 when we went out to Drum Castle - a historic family castle with woods and walled gardens to explore. Being ISO 100, it&rsquo;s always a bit of a risk here in Scotland. A sunny day can quickly turn cloudy and then all of a sudden f/4 is starting to be a push, and then going into the woods means I&rsquo;m down to f/1.4-2.8. However, I managed to get quite a few nice shots of the kids playing. I didn&rsquo;t really study the photos too much, as I tend to get multiple films developed at once there&rsquo;s more to look at.</p>
<p>What caused me to go back and really look at them was that numerous people commented on how much they liked the photo above. My wife had used it in our family calendar for this year and so when it came to that month, everyone commented on it.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/Kosmos-film-review/kosmos-2.jpg" alt="Woods + B&W is a favourite" title="Woods + B&amp;W is a favourite"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a single thing that makes up a photo, but a combination of everything. I do think this particular B&amp;W film stock looks good and compliments the scenes.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/Kosmos-film-review/kosmos-3.jpg" alt="Smile!" title="Smile!"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a niche stock and probably not all that available but if you do come across a roll, I&rsquo;d suggest giving it a try. I think if you can shoot it at ISO 50, the internet tells me your results will be even better! 🌞</p>

<p>My Leica M2 was made in 1962, according to the <a href="https://www.l-camera-forum.com/leica-wiki.en/index.php/Serial_Numbers_Leica_Cameras">serial number</a>, and it works just as well today as it did when it was first made.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my most favourite camera. I love the rangefinder focusing, and the feel and quality of it are outstanding. With a little care and maintenance this camera will last me another 60 years and beyond. My grandfather was a keen photographer and took many photos in his life. Unfortunately not many survived, and certainly none of his cameras. I don&rsquo;t know if he ever had a Leica, I suspect not, but if he did then this could&rsquo;ve been his. Even though it has no sentimental value, being from 1962 is the era of the few slide photos I do have from my grandfather, so it reminds me of him that way.</p>
<p>It is just a box, and it&rsquo;s the lenses and film emulsion that truly make the photos, but it&rsquo;s a box that makes you want to keep coming back to take more. I just hope film doesn&rsquo;t become such an expensive luxury that the camera gets used less and less.</p>

			 <p>I like big oranges. Navel or winter or Jaffa or  whatever they&rsquo;re called at various points of the year. They&rsquo;re always  big. Bigger than clementines or satsumas (what is the difference?) or  other citrus fruit of that colour but which are smaller. They&rsquo;re  satisfying to eat, they fill you up somewhat, generally juicy, and a  good size. They can be a pudding or a snack and you&rsquo;re not looking  around for another or something else. An all round good fruit.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/0a43cf219f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve found over the years of eating big oranges in public,  is that not many people like big oranges. I&rsquo;m surprised by this, given  all the reasons I&rsquo;ve stated why big oranges are good. What&rsquo;s also  surprising, but equally surprisingly common, is that people will comment about how the orange looks nice but state that they&rsquo;d never eat one.  They stand there and watch me take it out my bag or pick it up from its  resting place on my desk and begin the peeling process. Maybe they  mutter it, maybe they say it clear as day, or maybe they just think it,  but it&rsquo;s always the same: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never eat a big orange&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now is a  good time to talk about the process of peeling a big orange. I think  this is important as I think this is one of the main reasons why people  don&rsquo;t like eating big oranges. I could be wrong as I&rsquo;ve never challenged people to why they&rsquo;d never eat a big orange, out of respect of their  life choices, but I reckon the peeling plus one other item is why.</p>
<p>The peeling process does depend on the type of orange. (I&rsquo;m aware of Homer  Simpson taking a marriage class, whilst Hans Moleman takes an orange  eating class in a classic episode of The Simpson&rsquo;s (S5E22 if you must  know)).</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/f525c7fccb.jpg" alt="The Orange Eating Class" title="The Orange Eating Class"></p>
<p>Anyway, if the  skin is thick then it&rsquo;s typically very easy to peel. A single peel is  very achievable, even by the most novice of big orange eater. If the  skin is thin then it can be slow going, especially if you get into the  pick off tiny pieces mode. I recommend just skipping straight to the  knife and cutting it into segments if you find yourself in this  situation.</p>
<p>Start by rolling it around in your hands, then  alternative squeezing it with your thumbs. You&rsquo;re trying to &ldquo;soften it  up&rdquo; I find it helps relax or even break the bond of the skin to the  segments. However, you don&rsquo;t want to squeeze it too much as you might  burst the cell walls and end up in a messy situation. The next stage is  the first pierce of the skin. I like to find a spot around the Tropic of Cancer - imagine the orange as the Earth with the top that connects to  the tree as the North Pole. You pinch the skin together a little to try  and raise it away from the flesh. Do this with your thumb and index  finger, then pierce the skin with your thumb. You don&rsquo;t need to have big or sharp nails to do this. You need a nail but mine are short and work  just fine. Once you&rsquo;re in, then it&rsquo;s about trying to pull away the skin  without it breaking too soon. You&rsquo;re trying to peel off a reasonable  sized piece first, so that you have a good perimeter of skin in which to attack next. I use my thumb under the skin to separate it and work more of it away from the flesh. Once I have a decent sized piece, maybe 2&quot; / 5 cm diameter piece, then I head up to the North Pole to pull out the  pith stalk that&rsquo;s inside. It has quite a big of friction and if you try  with a too small piece of skin first then you risk breaking the skin  away from the top and having to tackle it again in a harder manner. Once this is done then it&rsquo;s a case of going around the rest of the skin with your thumb underneath and prising away more until it&rsquo;s all done.  Depending on the type of orange the South Pole can be tricker and  generally messier. This is where you might get a belly button looking  part which has lots of tiny segments inside all linked together in  middle segment of a cone shape. Depending on what&rsquo;s there I often find  that leaving the very southern tip still with skin on and then opening  up the orange into two halves makes getting this part out much easier.  It&rsquo;ll generally come away in two pieces on each half. It&rsquo;ll have some  orange on it that you could eat. However, if this is your first time I&rsquo;d suggest just composting that part with the skin and worry about it  another day.</p>
<p>From there you can just peel off large chunks of  white pith that you probably don&rsquo;t want to eat and then peel each  segment apart from the main group and enjoy. If the segments are torn or some came off with the skin then you just have to improvise and eat as  it comes. This is a situation which I can very clearly see why some  people would be put off. That brings us nicely to the second main reason why people don&rsquo;t eat big oranges:</p>
<h3 id="the-mess-">The Mess 😱</h3>
<p>This is  particularly important when you&rsquo;re not at home in the comfort of your  own kitchen or shower. This is where people at work look at you  dumbfounded. The risk you&rsquo;ve introduced into the workplace by bringing,  peeling and then eating a big orange when you never quite know the  outcome of the peeling is, in many people&rsquo;s view, unacceptable. The only credible mitigation that they&rsquo;d accept is not eating the orange in the  first place. Elimination, as the highest tier of risk mitigation  strategy, is all they&rsquo;d consider. This is where I feel they&rsquo;re missing  out. With great risk, comes great reward. That is not to say that I&rsquo;ll  risk it all, but with proper procedures and a competent operator, anyone can enjoy the fruits of a big orange.</p>
<p>But I understand. You don&rsquo;t want orange juice on your hands, or face, or trousers or clothes or  wherever, it&rsquo;s messy, sticky, and ruins your look. Again, follow the  process and you can be safe. If you&rsquo;re really worried, find a sink and  peel and eat the orange over it. Probably you want to practice this at  home as you might get even more comments than merely eating a big orange in the first place. You can then direct any stray juice into the sink  and wash your hands afterwards.</p>
<p>So I hope you can join me in the pleasure of eating a big orange wherever you may please and stand out amongst your peers.</p>

<p>Whilst I&rsquo;d love to get a Leica Q2 or even a GRIII, they&rsquo;re quite expensive (quite being the  understatement on the Q2). I&rsquo;m interested in getting a compact camera to just take anywhere without it being a big deal. My Fuji isn&rsquo;t huge but  it&rsquo;s not something that fits in the pocket or near enough. These last  two statements don&rsquo;t really support the Q2 whatsoever - it&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> compact and given its price, it&rsquo;ll always be a big deal - but I still want one.</p>
<p>This may be an excuse to buy more camera gear with the weak premise that  it&rsquo;s furfilling some other duty or need but I don&rsquo;t care. Particularly  as I&rsquo;m trying to find something that is cheap - ideally &lt;£100 but  we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>Two/three that I first found which are quite  interesting are the Olympus Pen E-PM2 (or maybe the 1 but that might be  too old) and the Lumix LX100. These are both micro 4/3s sensors, so a  compromise on sensor size but the benefit of being small. Whilst the  sensor size is smaller than even APS-C, it&rsquo;s still massively bigger than a phone.</p>
<p>The Olympus has an interchangable lens, and so you need to find a pancake lens to keep the size down. It&rsquo;s nearly 10 years old  but still has a respectable sensor. I&rsquo;m worried I like it as it&rsquo;s then  another money pit for new lenses. I could be fun for small telephoto  lenses but I also don&rsquo;t need them. I&rsquo;m also concerned that lens creep  would result in ending up with a camera just as big as my X-T2.</p>
<p>The Lumix LX100 looks really like a Fuji, and the lens says Leica. So  what&rsquo;s not to like! It' looks a bit old and, when turned on and the lens comes out, like quite big and unsubtle. However that&rsquo;s not really that  important. They also make a mark ii which has quite a few upgrades but  also higher price. The zoom lens is a handy feature and I like how you  can move between fixed focal lengths (e.g. 24, 28, 35 &hellip;) rather than  just a continous zoom. It&rsquo;s also quite good on video&hellip;not that I  generally take much video.</p>
<p>However, once I started this search the flood gates opened and every new camera I&rsquo;d investigate there&rsquo;d be 100  comments with 100 new models that everyone recommended as being &ldquo;much  better&rdquo;. Some of them that I noticed but still to look into are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lecia TL</li>
<li>Leica CL</li>
<li>Olympus EP-5</li>
<li>Olympus pen-F</li>
<li>Nikon Coolpix A</li>
<li>Fuji XF10</li>
<li>Lumix GX9</li>
<li>Ricoh GR2 / GR3</li>
<li>Fuji X-E2/2s/3</li>
<li>Canon EOS M200 and EF-M 22mm f/2</li>
<li>Lumix GX880</li>
<li>Lumix GX80</li>
</ul>
<p>These are becoming way beyond my cheap criteria, and has just become a research distraction.</p>
<p>Then there is also getting a top end iPhone, because I&rsquo;d always have it.  Although it&rsquo;s £1000 or whatever, and I don&rsquo;t like taking pictures with a phone.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve looked at them a few  times over the years but never bought one. They are pretty expensive - I guess from import duties etc. from Japan - and, you know, it&rsquo;s just a  notebook. However, I saw that the 2H 2022 ones were up for pre-order at a local online store and so I went for it. Being half the year means that it was maybe half the price.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/e96078519e.jpg" alt="Just half a year" title="Just half a year"></p>
<p>Look on reddit or forums or  wherever and people rave about the quality and paper and how nice they  feel. Again, something I didn&rsquo;t really buy when reading about it online. However, I&rsquo;m now in that camp of &ldquo;ermahgard this is the nicest notebook I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper feels smooth and is remarkably well  suited to just about any pen and ink type you have. Even the cover feels nice. A lot of people get covers and holders for their technos, which  do offer benefits such as pen holders and extra pockets for cards or  tickets etc., but the vanilla notebook seems durable enough to keep it  bare.</p>
<p>It comes in A6, which I initially thought would be too  small, but now I appreciate the small size, as it makes it easy to bring back and forth to work or anywhere else I want to take it.</p>
<p>The  biggest difference to most other notebooks, even ones with fancy paper  and covers, is the prescribed layout inside. There are a lot of sections inside it. It&rsquo;s similar to a diary but there&rsquo;s more than just days of  the week. There&rsquo;s a year index, a month calendar, the individual days, a timetable, a top 100 list, favourites list, contacts, and probably a  few other things I&rsquo;ve forgotten. The individual days have the date, the  moon phase, time slots, a meal journal, and a todo list part. There&rsquo;s  just so much in it but it&rsquo;s all very well organised and laid out.</p>
<p>Whilst there&rsquo;s a general way to use each section, you do have the freedom to  do what you want. I like using the yearly index for a habit tracker, and the top 100 list for a book tracker. I&rsquo;ve only just got mine so I might change these or find other uses.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/1cff942a9d.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/a9ec8dc40c.jpg" alt="Cutesy instructions included" title="Cutesy instructions included"></p>
<p>I could do all this with a  blank notebook, and one at the fraction of the price. However, I quite  like being told what to do. Like the defaults in software, good ones are well thought out and you&rsquo;d be wise to at least try it that way.</p>
<p>My half year doesn&rsquo;t start until 1st July, so I&rsquo;m only partially using it  right now. I&rsquo;ll see how I get one once the month rolls around. I think  it could be just what I&rsquo;m looking for, or it could be that I&rsquo;m  romanticising a heap of paper.</p>

			 <p>As much as I love computers, it does turn out that you can have too many.</p>
<p>A while back I decided that we needed another computer in the office for  when two people wanted to use a computer at the same time. Sounds  logically right? I managed to pick up a good deal on a Mac Mini. It was a 2012 model but top spec and still very performant today. The only bad  thing is that it’s stuck on an older version of macOS. I even installed a 2 TB SSD so I could manage all our photos on it. I figured it would be  nice to utilise Apple Photos and iCloud and get everything everywhere  and all the moments, and “on this day” etc. that it gives you. It would  also be a nice computer for learning some JavaScript and other general  software dev stuff. The final decider was that I’d then have DayOne on a desktop machine. DayOne being where we keep the family journal.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/89140de7ce.jpg" alt="The Mac, with the heat generating Apple Cinema HD" title="The Mac, with the heat generating Apple Cinema HD"></p>
<p>It turns out that whilst that all may be very true, I’m unable to use a  computer without wasting hours of time looking at random things online,  and not actually accomplishing any of the things I’d told myself were  the very reason I needed to get another computer. Maybe I did them some  of the time but I wasn’t happy with it. I actually had two monitors and  that made the desk look very cluttered as it came out at an angle into  the desk top. Going back to the single monitor did make it look less  overwhelming but it still didn’t change the fact that this extra  computer was really one too many. We have five computers, and three  raspberry pis, and a flock of iPads and Amazon tablets. I could probably manage without it.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/cd7bd6cb25.jpg" alt="Analogue mode: Expert" title="Analogue mode: Expert"></p>
<p>So now it’s packed up and ready to be sold (as long as  I’m certain) and the space cleared out. Originally I planned to just use it for paper, whether by pen or by typewriter, but I’ve actually found  it’s a nice spot for the iPad with the Smart Keyboard. I recently had to wipe and reinstall iPadOS as it was having issues and because of the  issues I didn’t want to restore it to how it was and just added apps as I went along. This meant it was quite bare. I tidied up the Home Screen  and am trying to keep it limited in scope. It’s still just as easy to  waste time on Reddit or the internet on the iPad as much as a desktop!</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3942b46eb8.jpg" alt="Trying to keep it simple" title="Trying to keep it simple"></p>
<p>I have my main writing apps with 1Writer, Day One and  WordPress. A few utilities, dynalist for lists, Fresco for my daughter  to draw, and the Day One widget so I actually see some of the older  entries without having to do anything. The second page of the iPad is  some streaming apps and misc. things I use occasionally or if I go away.</p>
<p>Even though I have a web browser, I’m less drawn to it on here than either  dedicated apps or the browser on the desktop. Generally there aren’t  apps on the desktop so it’s always the browser. Just these few small  hurdles to overcome seem to be enough to stop me wasting away time and  actually doing the things I set out to do in the first place.</p>
<p>I  still get sucked into random websites and whatever, either from emails  or links people send me, but it’s usually not the default starting place it tends to be with a desktop. Plus the other fact of when I feel like  pen and paper or typewriter, the iPad is small and easily moved out the  way.</p>
<p>I should sort out my e-ink screen and have something interesting show up on that whilst I sit here.</p>

			 <p>It’s been a long time since I last built a new keyboard. I think it was Christmas time 2018 when I bought the <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard">Iris keyboard</a> as the store had a sale on. Funnily enough that was a split keyboard. I keep meaning to write up a post about all my mechanical keyboards  (there’s been quite a few over the past nine years) and I’d enjoy going  back and remembering what I had.</p>
<p>Mostly what happens is I buy a  new kit or PCB thinking it’ll be the end game (after much research),  build it, configure the layout, generally mess about, and then stop  using it. After a few months I end up selling it online, probably to  fund the next one. Building is a fun part of it, so perhaps nothing  wrong with this cycle. Will this next one be any different, or have I  just been distracted by film photography and other things the past 3-4  years?</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3e671fe373.jpg" alt="Five blue PCBs" title="Five blue PCBs"></p>
<h2 id="the-ferris-sweep">The Ferris Sweep</h2>
<p>That’s the name of the <a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep">new keyboard</a> I’m going to build. A friend sent me a video of it a while ago and I decided I absolutely needed it. It’s a derivative of the <a href="https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris">Ferris keyboard</a>, but instead of various individual components on the board, it makes use of a microcontroller. This means it’s a lot easier to build and  microcontrollers are pretty common across mechanical keyboards. There  might be some other changes too but I didn’t spend much time looking at  the Ferris.</p>
<p>The final parts just arrived and so I’ve yet to build  it, the featured image is one like what I’m going to build but I went  with blue PCB and white keycaps. It was pretty easy to source, the  Github repo has a .gerber file which you can upload to a <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">PCB manufacturer’s website</a> and they’ll print them off for you (minimum of 5). It’s remarkable, and pretty cheap – $20 for 5, and then $15 for postage and taxes.  Unfortunately that’s where the cheapness ends. Now this is by no means  an expensive keyboard on the scale of mechanical keyboards, but it’s not nothing. The rest of the parts – controllers, switches, caps, etc. –  soon add up and whilst there are a lot of stores that sell these parts,  not all of them have everything you need – least not ones in the UK. I  ended up ordering everything else from <a href="https://splitkb.com/">splitkbd.com</a>. This store is based in EU and does have excellent stock – just it’s a €25 postage, so make sure you have everything you need!</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/fa3aa16bd5.jpg" alt="Everything else you need" title="Everything else you need"></p>
<p>I went with <a href="https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep/tree/main/Sweepv2.2">Sweepv2.2</a> and pink Kailh choc keys, these are the lightest pressure ones. The next thing will be to solder it all together, <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/">flash the controller</a> and get typing! Well, try typing. Making a new layout will be the  longest part, likely involving many iterations if I truely want to stick to it.</p>
<p>Will I stick with it? You never know! 😅</p>
<h3 id="update-31st-july-2022">Update 31st July 2022</h3>
<p>I build it, flashed the stock firmware and tested it out. All but one key works. Probably need to check the solder. However, that&rsquo;s as far as I  took it from back in May. It&rsquo;s sat on my desk reminding me that I wasted money on it. I have just sold one of the spare PCBs on ebay, so that  gets a little money back. I&rsquo;ve forgotten how much I did spend, maybe  about £90 in total.</p>

			 <p>If you visit the Fujifilm House of Photography in London, somewhere on the walls you’ll find a photograph that I took.  <em>Afraid it&rsquo;s been taken down now, and lives at home with me!</em></p>

<p>I had some friends who were keen to go astrophotography shooting and  invited me along one evening. We drove out to the mountains and tried  several places to take pictures. Prior to going I’d done a little  research into how you actually take photos of the sky at night. At the  time all I had was the Fuji X100F with it’s 23mm f/2. This turned out to be a good lens, it’s fast and wide-ish. If I had the WCL that would’ve  made it a 18mm f/2 and perhaps even better, however, I didn’t so I just  used what I had.</p>
<p>We took quite a lot and it was hard to tell if  anything was good or bad or what. This particular one was taken near the main highway just off some side farm road. It was so dark I couldn’t  see anything and just aimed the camera on the tripod in the general  direction. I probably couldn’t have lined up the telegraph wires better  if I tried! This was back in 2017 and we had a good night and finished  it with a stop at a MacDonald’s on the highway for hot chocolate. I also got the photo printed to give to one of my friends who went with us  that night as a leaving gift.</p>

<p>Fast forward to September 2020, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201219100036/https://fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/special/X100anniversary/">Fujifilm announced the 10th anniversary of the X100 series competition</a>. You can submit any photo as long as it has been taken with a X100  series camera. As most of my photos are of family and friends, I didn’t  have too many that might be suitable and this astro shot was the one I  immediately thought of. The first prize was a brand new, shiny X100V.  They had multiple first prizes for different regions, so I wasn’t  competing against everyone, just everyone in the UK!</p>
<p>The following February I got an email saying I was one of the 10 runners up! Woohoo!  🎉 (although would’ve been nice to win the camera given I’d just  recently sold my X100F and was missing it a little bit 📷). My prize was a nice tote bag, and a hand written congratulations note. The other  part was that they would print and display the photo in their gallery.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/I-have-a-photo-in-an-actual-gallery/x100-prize.jpg" alt="The Prize" title="The Prize"></p>
<p>Except then COVID had locked everything down and they decided to postpone it a few times. However, now the gallery is open! Unfortunately, I live a  long way from London and I’m not going there any time soon, so I won’t  get to see it in person. They have offered to post it up to me after the exhibition, so that’ll be nice.</p>
<p>The Fujifilm store looks like a  nice play to go if you like photography and cameras, they always have  gallery one and no doubt lots of toys to play with.</p>

<p>I believe <del>it’s</del> was open now until 30th June 2022. <a href="https://fujifilm-houseofphotography.com/">Have a look at their site.</a></p>
<p><em>Update =  They&rsquo;ve since posted the framed version to me at home. Now I just need to decide what I&rsquo;m doing with it.</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A while back I decided I  needed (yes, needed) another laptop. I do have a Thinkpad T450s already  but my daughter has pretty much taken it completely and uses it for  school work. So I went on the hunt for a new one. I wanted it to have  USB-C so that I could use my existing dock and setup at home that I have from working at home with my work laptop.</p>
<p>![Prepare the work area](thinkpad-t490-thumb.JPEG &ldquo;Prepare the work area)</p>
<p>I started trying to figure out which model was the oldest I could get,  but then saw that I should try and find one with the 8th intel cpu (or  higher) as these were the low powered quad core CPUs which had a much  bigger performance boost compared to previous generational increases.  This meant T490(s) or 6th gen X1 Carbon (2018). It was pretty easy to  find out that the T490 was the cheapest, and offered the most ports and  expandability.</p>
<p>I found a bargain on eBay but lo-and-behold the  screen was a horrible 1366×768. I thought they stopped selling laptops  with such dire screens. But no, and in fact you can still get models  with them today from Lenovo. I later rechecked the listing and it  conveniently didn’t specify anything about the screen resolution.</p>
<p>I had the choice of sending it back and buying a new one, (or sending it  back and not getting another as why do I need six computers in the  house), living with it, or upgrading the screen. I did upgrade the  screen of my X230 about 5 years ago and that was pretty easy. It looked  like buying a replacement screen would be the cheapest. Especially if I  can sell the old screen to recoup some money.</p>
<p>Finding the right model to get was pretty straight forward. A quick visit to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/thinkpad">/r/thinkpad</a> and searching for screen replacement so led to finding out which model is best to get. There’s also <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-s-Panel-Lottery-continues-with-3-different-14-inch-LowPower-displays.426538.0.html">this review</a> of screens by notebookcheck. Supposedly it’s the Innolux N140HCG-GQ2,  and this is what I bought from an interestingly named store of  Softhands.co.uk. I’ve just noticed there’s a B1 version but don’t know  if it’s better.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/b2eaa13dc5.jpg" alt="Plastic clips and a bit of stick is all the keeps the screen attached" title="Plastic clips and a bit of stick is all the keeps the screen attached">

<img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/60dd195c1e.jpg" alt="The best part" title="The best part"></p>
<p>There are a couple of videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvAkA-QuD4E">YouTube</a> showing you how to do it, and even some videos by <a href="https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/solutions/ht508135">Lenovo</a>. Like all ThinkPads there’s the <a href="https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/t490_p43s_hmm_en.pdf?linkTrack=PSP:ProductInfo:HarwareManual">service manual</a> which has a lot of good information for any upgrade or repair you might want to me.</p>
<p>I used a small screw driver to start separating the bezel from the lid  and then a metal credit card to separate it further. There are a few  sticky parts that need pulling apart. You need to apply more force than  you think to get it to separate.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/412fe26cd7.jpg" alt="Screen connector" title="Screen connector"></p>
<p>Detaching the cable is the fiddliest part. There’s a catch to lift up and over  and then the connector slides out parallel to the main board towards the lid. I have some pointy nose tweezers that helped with this part.  Getting this back in when reassembling is equally fiddly and you need to make sure it goes all the way in so that the two parts are flush  together.</p>
<p>The first boot and the Lenovo logo appeared but then it  all went blank. Oh uh! I restarted and went into the BIOS – the screen  was working fine again – poked about in the settings but there wasn’t  anything to do regarding the screen so I restarted and, Success! Windows booted and I could change the resolution to 1920×1080. 🎉</p>
<p>There  is a balance between screen area, resolution and pixel density. I find  native 1080p a good balance between them on a 14” screen. A higher  resolution and everything gets too small to read. You can up the scaling but then you start to lose space, also I find non-integer scaling, such as 1.5 or 150%, can sometimes lead to funny text or other UI  annoyances. It’s been a while since I tried, so I’m sure OSs have  improved this. You can avoid this by going with a 4K screen and doing  200% scaling, and it looks lovely, probably also because the panel has  full colours and great brightness.</p>
<p>So if you have a low resolution screen, I’d definitely encourage you to look into replacing it  yourself. Now I’m off to install Linux on it! 🐧</p>

			 <p>For my <a href="https://alexjj.github.io/Meditations/">Meditations Tiddlywiki</a>, I wanted to make each statement an individual tiddler.  Whilst it doesn&rsquo;t add a great deal to the site right now (beyond just viewing the minimum amount, the random tiddler button, and following the tiddlywiki mantra), I think it&rsquo;ll be useful later on. Over time I&rsquo;d like to add my own thoughts or interpretations to them, or maybe categorise favourite ones with new tags. Plus they might be useful for other people who can export tiddlers or download the file.</p>
<p>I had the site previously but it was one tiddler per book, and that didn&rsquo;t make it very usable beyond just reading.</p>
<p>I find the easiest way to import lots of tiddlers is via a JSON file. Luckily I&rsquo;d found a JSON file of Meditations some time ago. It&rsquo;s easy to find the text but that&rsquo;s not always as easily parsed as as structured document. The JSON was just book and then each line. I still needed to get the title, tags, and fields sorted out before I could import into a blank Tiddlywiki.</p>
<p>The general structure of JSON to be imported looks like this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The <code>section</code> and <code>book</code> are fields I added and the rest should be obvious. Tags with spaces need to be in <code>[[ ]]</code>. So all I&rsquo;d need to do is iterate over the JSON file and create new entries that matched this structure.</p>
<p>The first issue I came across was knowing how many sections per book there are. I made a new list of the number of sections and stored that in the meditations.json file. Whilst not necessary (as I could&rsquo;ve used the code to generate this later on), I thought it might be helpful and more efficient to compute it once and store the results. <code>data</code> is the json file as you&rsquo;ll see shortly.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/2021/11/25/monte-carlo-simulation-in-excel/">Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel with Python</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/2021/11/25/monte-carlo-simulation-in-excel/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-11-25 01:00:00 &#43;0100">Nov 25, 2021</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There are quite a few blogs that show you how to do Monte Carlo simulations using python. A very accessible one is from <a href="https://pbpython.com/monte-carlo.html">Practical Business Python</a>. Always a great site for python in the workplace for non-devs. However, I couldn&rsquo;t find one that did just what I wanted, namely, take a model I&rsquo;d already built in Excel and then apply some randomness and plot the S-curve (cumulative distribution function).</p>
<p>Maybe if I&rsquo;d searched more I&rsquo;d find one but instead I just got on with it. I also used to have some software at work that did this for me, it was an add-on to Excel but work stopped paying for it and I found it hard to justify it (it&rsquo;s an Oracle product so no doubt pricey). Plus I always love an excuse to try and learn a bit more python.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know, Monte Carlo simulation is a way to capture uncertainity. If a friend is driving to your house, 50 miles away, and they travel at 50 mph it&rsquo;ll take then one hour right? Well, not always. Maybe they are keen on the gas and drive faster, or maybe there&rsquo;s an accident and they get stuck. You just never know. So you could use monte carlo to say that their average journey speed could be from 40-60 mph, then you randomly sample many many times from that range and work out the time it takes. Do it 10,000 times and you then have 10,000 results that you can draw estimates from, e.g. the average time. You can also plot the results and show the whole range.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>The main python tools to get this working is <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> for the random sampling and <a href="https://www.xlwings.org/">xlwings</a> for interacting with Excel. Like all python libraries, these tools do <strong>way</strong> more than just what I need. I also used pandas, seaborn and matplotlib. Probably unnecessary but they&rsquo;re quick to work with as I already know the gist of them.</p>
<p>Then of course there&rsquo;s Excel, which needs no introduction. I&rsquo;d already built my deterministic model in Excel, where all my inputs were in one table that could be changed and then the outputs were in another to be read.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always going to be the choice of what do you do in python and what do you do in Excel. As I&rsquo;d started in Excel I didn&rsquo;t want to waste time recreating stuff in python so all the calculations are in Excel. This is slow (but still fast enough for my use case). Depending on how advanced or complex your model becomes it may be better to move more of it to Excel. The trade off with this is now only you can use it or understand it.</p>
<p>Before I forget, there&rsquo;s also VS Code. I use it at work as it&rsquo;s free, I can install it without Admin rights and IT department haven&rsquo;t questioned me on it (yet!), unlike PyCharm 🤔. I like to make use of the #%% cell divider in it. Partially as I&rsquo;d been using this for a long time with Spyder (before VS Code existed) and also as it seems like a better way to work vs. notebooks. At least for me.</p>
<p>As always the documentation of the libraries is a great place to start - often the best place before you jump to tutorials.</p>
<h2 id="the-randomness">The Randomness</h2>
<p>Your uncertainity takes shape in many different ways. Sometimes is a continuous range, like our speed example before, or it&rsquo;s discrete, like picking your starter Pokémon. In fact whatever the uncertainity is, numpy has a <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html">method</a> to help you represent it. I actually think working out what your uncertainity looks like is the hardest part of all of it. Perhaps you could even have uncertainity on the uncertainity&hellip;Generally you want to ask an expert, maybe yourself, maybe someone else in your company, or whatever you can find online that seems reasonable. You can, of course, just try different ones in your model and see if it actually makes a difference to the decision you&rsquo;re trying to make.</p>
<p>I ened up using <code>choice</code> and <code>uniform</code> distributions. Choice being my starter Pokémon, and uniform distribution being a range of numbers but they&rsquo;re all equally likely to be picked.</p>
<p>My choice was actually choosing a range of numbers in Excel which would all change depending on what choice was picked.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>I made a few controls at the top so I could adjust the ranges of things. Fairly basic stuff otherwise, which I&rsquo;m sure can be done better but was good enough for me. Being so simple makes it pretty easy to understand, even if you&rsquo;ve never used these libraries before.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a loop that does the random sampling, insert those values into excel, excel then recalculates, then it takes the answer out and appends it to a list. Repeat that <code>iterations</code> times and there&rsquo;s my data.</p>
<p>I create a pandas dataframe (probably lazy and it could be done in numpy but as I said, lazy.) from the list and then calculate some metrics from it. The P values are commonly used at work to express the range. Where P90 meaning 90% probability that the value is ≤ X. Or often viewed as most optimistic result, with P10 therefore being the most pessimistic result. Actually, I&rsquo;ve seen companies define these in reverse so check before you confuse people.</p>
<p>Seaborn has a handy empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf), that saves me thinking anything whatsoever (that&rsquo;s the whole objective whilst at work right?). So I make one of those for the PowerPoint, and print out the final numbers in a nice line.</p>
<p>The other nice thing with VS Code is the data viewer. I can save the plot to a file and copy and paste the table of results straight from it without having to write it to a file first. Tiny things like that make life so much easier.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So pretty straight forward to make your deterministic Excel model into a fully probabilistic model capturing all the uncertainity and demonstrating all the potential outcomes that can happen. For free, in about 30 minutes of work.</p>
<p>I think probabilistic models should be used more often. Very rarely is it that everything is always known exactly and whilst your calculation isn&rsquo;t wrong, it&rsquo;s only one possible outcome. Better to give your decision maker (or yourself) a range of outcomes than just one. Tell them &ldquo;they&rsquo;re buying the curve&rdquo;. Then hope the final result actually lands on the curve 😅</p>

<p>Like all favourites the real favourite always depends. It depends on the intent, at least for me. I suppose you could do a &ldquo;of all time&rdquo; or &ldquo;best overall&rdquo; style favourite. I think a common distinction is form over function. There are a lot of things that look great but are practically useless, even if - like a teapot - they should be used, they still may remain annoying.</p>
<p>So having said all that&hellip;I present the Sabichi classic stainless steel teapot.</p>
<p>It comes in a variety of sizes 720ml, 1300ml, and 1900ml, so big enough for even the largest tea drinking family. It&rsquo;s also very reasonably priced at £16 for the medium sized one.</p>
<p>So why do I like it so much? It does the job very well: It has good capacity, it has a classic, timeless look and most importantly, it pours well. So many teapots have terrible spouts that drip or splash tea everywhere. I enjoy filling it up with 1.3 litres and then having several good sized mugs of tea. A teapot for one is fine but when visitors are around you don&rsquo;t want to have to decide between a teabag per mug or tiny cups to use the tea pot.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/8b8e1ce1b4.jpg" alt="The joys of working at home" title="The joys of working at home"></p>
<p>It has been perfect for working at home when the children are also home. I could make a good amount of tea and hide away in the office working, and not be worried about coming out and upsetting whatever is going on because I&rsquo;m parched.</p>
<p><img src="https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3bff3ff298.jpg" alt="Teapot"></p>
<p>I just worry that I should maybe buy a spare in case this one breaks&hellip;</p>

This guide is considerably old. However, the concept will still work but likely the configuration is now different.
:::</p>
<p><em>My version of getting started with beancount.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this post is to walk you through my setup of how I manage my personal finances. I&rsquo;ve read similar posts like these and found them useful to get ideas about what to do myself. Hopefully in turn, by presenting my setup it&rsquo;ll give you some ideas too.</p>
<p>At the core of system is <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/">beancount</a>. I&rsquo;ll explain it a little more shortly, but essentially it is a tool that reads a plain text file of my financial activity and undertakes double-entry accounting in order to easily assess my finances in any way imaginable. My whole system actually involves several other tools and services in order to make it work how I want.</p>
<p>Using a tool like beancount means I am free to set everything up the way I want that works for me, and not the way someone thinks I want it. It also means my data is free from constraints.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-wanted">What I wanted</h2>
<ul>
<li>Data stored in plain text</li>
<li>Add information quickly, and from anywhere</li>
<li>A tool that could do everything - transactions, multiple currencies, stocks, investing, taxes, etc.</li>
<li>A tool that could answer any question I had about my finances</li>
<li>Fancy graphs on a website I could safely access anywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what I have.</p>

ledger-cli like financial tools are the best.
:::</p>
<p>Finding your system takes time and there can be many decisions to make. It took me a long time to realise the benefit of tracking my expenses and what my money was doing. When I did first start I used <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/">YNAB</a>, You Need A Budget. I didn&rsquo;t really need a budget. I wasn&rsquo;t living pay cheque to pay cheque and had some savings, but I had no idea how much I should or could save a year or how much was I actually spending. What really was the cost of that holiday? My friend had started using YNAB, and I picked it up in a Steam sale for $15. It&rsquo;s pretty decent, easy to use, import transactions, tracking, graphs. I liked it. The first problem I found was that it wasn&rsquo;t setup for more than one currency. If you wanted more you had to make two separate budgets, and this meant that my expense categories ended up being a bit weird and after about 9 months of use I found I hadn&rsquo;t set them up well. This ultimately meant I could get the information I wanted out of the tool. I could go back and adjust all the expenses into different accounts but I didn&rsquo;t want to spend that time, and even then I&rsquo;d still have to export everything into a spreadsheet to do further calculations. I&rsquo;d also read some rumours that the next version was going to be a web only tool.</p>
<p>Now YNAB keeps it&rsquo;s data in some particular way and whilst there&rsquo;s an export all function from the tool, I was worried about longevity of it. This was reinforced when they released the new version that is web only and announced they&rsquo;d stop support for the desktop application after one year. Probably it&rsquo;ll work for many years forward, but one day something will be changed and it&rsquo;ll cease to work. Also the new version was going to have a monthly subscription&hellip;</p>
<p>So I started my search for <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Other#Finance">alternatives</a>. Another feature I wanted was for it to be open source and natively run on linux, YNAB did via wine, but certainly wasn&rsquo;t open source and that always bugged me. I try to encourage others to support and use open source and here I was doing the opposite. I had kept a duplicate ledger using GNUCash when I started with YNAB to see if I liked either of them, and I installed KMyMoney and even tried LibreOffice database program but they all had annoyances with multiple currencies and other things. Having something that could manage multiple currencies turned out to be my main decision criteria, and that&rsquo;s when I finally sat down and read the <a href="http://ledger-cli.org/">ledger</a> manual.</p>
<p>For about 3 months I started using YNAB and ledger side by side and I came to realise that ledger was the perfect tool for me. It effortlessly handles multiple currencies, I can query my data any which way I like and all my data is stored as plain text I can version control and easily read for the rest of my life. Actually, I started with beancount first for a week or two but then switched to ledger. After four months I ended up going back to beancount.</p>
<h3 id="beancount">Beancount</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got here and don&rsquo;t know what double-entry accounting or beancount or ledger are, I&rsquo;m going to link you to this <a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/">great site</a> which explains it all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to save why I chose beancount over ledger for another post. The basics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beancount (like HLedger) reads the file then orders the transactions before processing; Ledger processes them in the order they appear. This means with beancount I can lay out my files anyway I want.</li>
<li>Strict rules on writing transaction. This is the bit I touch, I&rsquo;m bound to do it wrong.</li>
<li>Being able to close accounts when they&rsquo;re done, so they don&rsquo;t appear anymore in reports etc.</li>
<li>Cleaner (in my opinion) way of balance assertions</li>
<li>I found the query syntax easier to understand</li>
<li>and some other misc things.</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing that made me switch? Seeing <a href="https://github.com/beancount/fava">fava</a>. This is an awesome project and the author has made several other contributions to the beancount world, one of which is the organised <a href="https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Beancount is by no means perfect, but it fits well in my system.</p>
<h2 id="the-system">The System</h2>
<p>Now to talk about the parts that make up my finances system. These are all the tools/apps that I use which I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>
<p>Components:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/">beancount</a>: The accounting tool written and maintained by Martin Blais.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/beancount/fava">fava</a> A web interface to my data. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://fava.pythonanywhere.com">demo</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a>: Emacs and Vim ready to go.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackedit.io/">stackedit</a>: In-browser editor. Many alternatives out there.</li>
<li><a href="https://keep.google.com">Google Keep</a>: Google&rsquo;s note taking tool - good for quick notes on my phone on the go.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alexjj/money-scripts/blob/master/ukindexprices.py">Python price importer script</a>: Of my own creation</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>: Cross platform file syncing tool</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a>: Host, run, and code Python in the cloud.</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in">Gitlab</a>: Git as a service, and unlimited free private repos.</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole system is based around writing transactions that beancount can process and then analysing the data through fava.</p>
<p>The other tools aid me in doing this at home and away, although away generally means at work.</p>
<h2 id="entering-data">Entering Data</h2>
<h3 id="at-home">At home</h3>
<p>Plain text means any text editor will do. However, some people have written helpers, namely for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/8b8bc8efbf51b6fcca0bfbb38a40fddcfd939a9e/src/elisp/beancount.el?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default">emacs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nathangrigg/vim-beancount">vim</a>, and <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Beancount">sublime</a>. These generally auto complete account names and maybe a few other features like aligning the numbers and running <code>bean-check</code> to look for errors. The emacs beancount minor mode, written by Martin, has the most features - although not as many as ledger-mode, and if you already use emacs then it&rsquo;s a no brainer.  I&rsquo;d tried emacs and vim in the past as I was curious as to what they were all about but as I&rsquo;m not a developer and spend more time in Excel than anything else I didn&rsquo;t have the time to learn them to get the most out of it.</p>
<p>When I was using ledger I spent time in setting up emacs but it was all a bit messy and I felt like I was spending a lot of time just trying to setup emacs and not really doing what I wanted to be doing (plotting more account graphs of course!), that&rsquo;s when I found <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">spacemacs</a>. This is a great project and bakes a whole load of great emacs plugins into a single and managed distribution. I probably only use a tiny percentage of the features but for editing and adding transactions is very slick. Check it out if you haven&rsquo;t. Sublime text would probably be my next best option for editing my beancount file. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get started with and has some autocompletion, but not that great.</p>
<p>Another reason why I stuck with emacs was to use <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org mode</a> to structure my file. With Ledger I quickly found having one file with everything didn&rsquo;t work too well. Especially when using xacts comand from emacs to add a transaction, so I split it into individual account files and added includes to my master ledger file. This was okay, but meant I had to move between a lot of files and as ledger doesn&rsquo;t rearrange transactions some reports and queries gave weird outputs. I worked around this by telling ledger to print everything to a ledger.all file then running queries and reports on that, but that was a pain. Probably there&rsquo;s a better way to do it but I never found it.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip;I now have one file that&rsquo;s broken into headers with org and I just open or close them to see transactions. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Options</li>
<li>Accounts</li>
<li>Assets</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bank 1</li>
<li>Bank2</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Liabilities
<ul>
<li>Credit Card 1</li>
<li>Mortgage</li>
<li>Loan 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/spacemacs.png" alt="Plain Text"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still learning all the keyboard commands but I can quickly add new transactions and make changes. I don&rsquo;t use any importer tools (tools to take csv/ofx file from bank and convert into beancount input) as I tend to update once a week and there aren&rsquo;t many transactions to add each time. Plus I like to look at each one and think about what we bought and if it was really worth it. This <a href="https://github.com/jbms/beancount-import">one</a> looks promising, and Martin is working on a feature as part of beancount to do this.</p>
<p>These are the beancount minor-mode keys:</p>
<p>Key     | Action                   | Description
&mdash;&mdash;- | &mdash;- &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- | &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;
C-c '   | Insert Account           | Bring up selection to choose an account
C-c C-g | Set transaction flag     | Change ! to *
C-c r   | Refresh account list     | Read the file to update accounts for using <code>C-c '</code>
C-c l   | Runs bean-check          | Opens a new window with the results
C-c q   | Query                    | Runs bean-query
C-c x   | Context                  | Shows other transaction related, bean-doctor context
C-c k   | Linked                   | Shows related transactions. Seems to be the same as context.
C-c ;   | Align to previous number | Aligns the costs to the transaction above
C-c :   | Align numbers            | Should align all the numbers but doesn&rsquo;t work for me. Could be spacemacs issue though.</p>
<p>Spacemacs has good completion from helm (I think!) so I don&rsquo;t use insert account. Mostly use the transaction flag, running bean-check and aligning to previous numbers.</p>
<p>Once I&rsquo;ve updated my transactions I commit the changes and push to my private repo on gitlab.</p>
<h3 id="and-away">And Away</h3>
<p>Sometimes I want to add some transactions when I&rsquo;ve got some spare time at work, to save doing it at home in the evening, or if I&rsquo;m away. All this really means is I need some way of editing my files from another computer. Depending on that other computer it can be really easy or really hard. My work is somewhere in between, I can generally access most websites but I can&rsquo;t install anything and SSH is blocked. Other computers I&rsquo;d use might be at someone&rsquo;s house or in a public place and generally all I can guarantee is web access.</p>
<p>Again, even just web access there are a multitude of options and I keep looking out for better ones. However, as it currently stands I use dropbox and stackedit. Dropbox also acts as a nice way to sync the file between my computers at home, and it offers version control from the website for every time the file is saved  - which I&rsquo;ve used! Dropbox doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in editor, or it certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for .beancount files, so I need something else to edit it. That&rsquo;s where I use stackedit. It can open files from Dropbox and Google Drive and save things to various places too. It&rsquo;s meant as an authoring site for websites as it&rsquo;s primarily a markdown editor. There are a bunch of these sites so whichever you like. Writebox for Chrome is also a nice app. There&rsquo;s no autocompletion or fancy features but generally I&rsquo;m copying and pasting old transactions and updating the date and amount 90% of the time. It&rsquo;s not as efficient but if I&rsquo;m making use of deadtime it&rsquo;s efficient to me.</p>
<p>For quick notes from my phone, such as significant cash transactions or ones with store cards I rarely use (and often forget to check), I use google keep. I can add a note very quickly and it saves the time and date automatically and I just add the key info. I then look at this later and transcribe into beancount at home and archive the note. I use Google Keep for other random notes but any note app you use would work. The key was finding something with a good mobile interface for quick input.</p>
<p><em>2016-03-03 Update =  I now use Gitlab to host my beancount files so I only update on the gitlab website if I&rsquo;m not at home. Although I&rsquo;ve found it better just to use Google Keep and update properly at home (I always forget to pull changes when at home!).</em></p>
<h2 id="beancount-setup">Beancount Setup</h2>
<p>One of the hardest parts to getting to use beancount was navigating the <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/index">docs</a> to figure out how to use it. Not that the docs are bad in content, far from it. Martin writes huge quantities of high quality documents. These are hosted on google docs and makes it super easy for others to comment, make corrections and ask questions. No other project have I been able to so easily make updates or clarify points as easily. The only downside is you can&rsquo;t search across all of the files to find some particular item. Generally I have to open up two or three docs that I think the answer might be in. When I first started using it I literally opened every doc in a separate tab and read through them all and constantly reference between them. <a href="https://github.com/aumayr">Dominik Aumayr</a> has made a nice sphinx generated site that pulls these links together although with the docstrings from the code in his <a href="https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/">site</a>. You&rsquo;ll still need to read a lot of them but it&rsquo;s a good starting place, and I think him and Martin are working to pull the content of Google Docs into it.</p>
<p><em>So read all the docs!</em></p>
<p>These are good to get going:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5At-z1sP8rgwYLHso5sEy3u4rMnIUDDgob9Y_BYuWE/">Getting started</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-gsmwK551lSyuHboVLW3xbLhh99JfoKIbNnZSJxteE/">Tutorial</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/cookbook/index.html">Cookbooks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m only going to show you the basics to get started, and point out some (probably not all) the differences to ledger.</p>
<p>Compared to ledger, beancount requires more &ldquo;settings&rdquo; in the file. You have to open all your accounts, declare commodities and generally be more descriptive. I like this as it reduces the chances of errors in either what I type in or what beancount thinks I want to happen.</p>
<h3 id="your-filebeancount">Your file.beancount</h3>
<p>So a basic file will start like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-org-mode" data-lang="org-mode">;; -*- mode: org; mode: beancount; -*-
;; My legder file

* Options ; Beancount options

option &quot;title&quot; &quot;My Finances&quot;
option &quot;operating_currency&quot; &quot;USD&quot; ; The main currencies you use
option &quot;operating_currency&quot; &quot;ABC&quot;
option &quot;operating_currency&quot; &quot;GBP&quot;

** Accounts ; Open all the accounts you have

2016-02-28 open Assets:BC:Bank:Checking    ABC ; You can specify commodities
2016-02-28 open Assets:US:Bank:Savings
2016-02-28 open Liabilities:UK:Bank:Loan
2016-02-28 open Liabilities:US:Bank:Credit
2016-02-28 open Equity:Opening-Balances

; When you start you have existing balances
; one way to manage this is to have an opening balance transaction.
; Alternatively you can use balance and pad.

** Opening Balances
2016-02-28 * &quot;Opening Balances&quot;
    Assets:BC:Bank:Checking          1000.00 ABC
    Assets:US:Bank:Savings            500.00 USD
    Liabilities:UK:Bank:Loan        -1000.00 GBP
    Liabilities:US:Bank:Credit      -1890.00 USD
    Equity:Opening-Balances

* Commodities ; Declaring cash and stocks and imaginary commodities you use

* Banking ; Keep transactions under here for banks
 - US
   + Bank 1 ; Org more sub headings for each country/bank

* Liabilities ; e.g. credit card transactions
; again sub divided by country/accounts

* Investments ; accounts related to investing

* Another other accounts or ways to divide up your system

* Prices
; Price data, or maybe an include to a price file
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s probably worthwhile looking at some of the example beancount files Martin has in his <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/8b8bc8efbf51/examples/?at=default">repo</a>. Either example.beancount or files under the folders.</p>
<p>A basic transaction looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>YYYY-MM-DD * &quot;Payee&quot; &quot;Optional Description&quot; #optional-tag
    Account:Category:Sub-Category  1234.00 XYZ
    Account:Category:Sub-Category  -123.34 XYZ ;Optional Comment
    Account:Category:Sub-Category
</code></pre><p>Some differences from ledger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account can only be:
<ul>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>Liabilities</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Income</li>
<li>Expenses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>*</code> has to be present, or it can be a <code>!</code>. Generally <code>!</code> means uncleared and <code>*</code> cleared.</li>
<li>The payee and description must be in &ldquo;quotes&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Tags are #</li>
<li>Prices are in this format:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>2016-02-25 price GBP                  1.40 USD
</code></pre><p>You have unlimited sub-categories, but a good design is:
<code>Account:Country:Institution:Account-type</code></p>
<p>e.g.
<code>Assets:US:Chase:Checking</code></p>
<p>For expenses I got a lot of good inspiration from the <a href="https://www.mint.com/mint-categories">Mint list</a>. However, I&rsquo;d suggest you start small and grow as you use it.</p>

<p>Instructions to install it from the <a href="https://github.com/aumayr/fava#installation">github repo</a>:
Install it from pip:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo pip3 install beancount-fava
</code></pre><p>From command line run it with:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>fava /Volumes/Ledger/example.beancount
</code></pre><p>Go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mostly self explanatory to navigate and use. Don&rsquo;t forget to check out the <a href="http://fava.pythonanywhere.com/">demo</a>.</p>
<p>Beancount includes the <code>bean-query</code> command which allows you to enter sql like code (bql - bean query language) to generate some reports. Fava has a view that allows you to enter your bql and see the result on the page and even export the data to CSV/Excel. Here&rsquo;s a brief example:</p>
<p>Go to Custom Query and enter:</p>

<h3 id="beancount-data-analysis-extras">Beancount data analysis extras</h3>
<p>The only other analysis I do is taking the monthly summary data and putting it into a Google docs spreadsheet. This is so I can do some forecasting on how much I think I&rsquo;m going to spend this year and then how much I could save. When I first started tracking expenses I became a bit obsessed and didn&rsquo;t buy anything, I was trying to maximise how much I saved. However, this soon got tiring and a little depressing. Yes, saving for the future/rainy days is very important but I should still be able to enjoy myself now. I figured it would be better if I had a target savings amount, and as long as I met that, I could spend the rest on &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo;. In fact this probably helps me reach my goals but not making saving a chore. So the spreadsheet estimates how much I could save and then I set my target based on that. When I want to buy something I don&rsquo;t need, like a new camera, I can see what my trend is and know either if I can get it or how long I should wait before I can buy it.</p>
<p>This is only going to get easier once PIVOT BY is released for bean-query.</p>
<p>Within beancount itself there is the bean-report function, a lot (perhaps all) of these reports are covered in fava but it&rsquo;s a quick tool to spit out something if you need it in a hurry from the command line.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re generated with <code>bean-report FILENAME.beancount {report name}</code>.  Running &ndash;help against bean-report will show a list of the reports and what they do. This can also print out your transactions in hledger/ledger format in case you want to use one of those tools, although special features of (h)ledger may not be covered.</p>
<h2 id="free-fava-hosting">Free fava hosting</h2>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to access fava, this incredible tool, from anywhere? Given the demo is hosted on pythonanywhere, I figured I should be able to host my own beancount file there too. Plus I knew from using pythonanywhere before there&rsquo;s a really easy password protection option you can setup to keep your data hidden. So here&rsquo;s what to do:</p>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Create an account at <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/web.apps.PNG" alt="Make a new web app"></p>
<p>Add a new web app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manual configuration</li>
<li>Python 3.4</li>
</ol>
<p>Once it&rsquo;s made, edit WSGI under Code and replace everything with this. Adjust the location of your file and config.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> fava.application <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> app <span style="color:#66d9ef">as</span> application

load_file()
</code></pre></div><p>Save it and go back to the webapp page. Add a user and password at the bottom, I&rsquo;d recommend <strong>NOT</strong> your pythonanywhere user/password and something long and unique, preferably generated and saved in a password manager like <a href="https://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a>.
<img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/password.PNG" alt="Add a password">
Now we need to install fava, to do this we&rsquo;re going to use a script that&rsquo;ll also be used for updating fava automatically.</p>
<h4 id="fava-installation">Fava Installation</h4>
<p>Again, inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/aumayr/fava/tree/master/util/pythonanywhere/fava">fava demo site</a> lets set it up so new updates are automatically installed.</p>
<p>From the dashboard, go to consoles and start a Bash console.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s pull a copy of the code, this isn&rsquo;t necessary but might be useful in the future.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/aumayr/fava.git
</code></pre></div><p>If you want to change the default settings, copy the config file to your home directory and update the wsgi above. The web server will then reference this. I&rsquo;ve not found the need to change anything, but perhaps changing the <a href="https://github.com/aumayr/fava/blob/master/fava/default-settings.conf#L8-L9">theme</a> might be one you do.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cp ~/fava/fava/default-settings.conf ~
</code></pre></div><p>You could always just pull the file directly from github if you don&rsquo;t want to clone the whole project:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aumayr/fava/master/fava/default-settings.conf
</code></pre><p>If you use a settings file make sure you update the wsgi file above to reference it.</p>
<p>Now we need to make the update script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>nano update.sh
</code></pre><p>Add this code to it, ensuring you change the USER name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash

<span style="color:#75715e"># Add user bin</span>
export PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$PATH:/home/USER/.local/bin

<span style="color:#75715e"># Upgrade fava</span>
pip3 install --user --upgrade beancount-fava

<span style="color:#75715e"># Reload web page</span>
touch /var/www/USER_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
</code></pre></div><p>Make it executable and run it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">chmod +x update.sh
./update.sh
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/console.PNG" alt="Installing fava from pip"></p>
<p>Your site should now be working, but we don&rsquo;t have a beancount file there. To test it out you could just manually upload your file from the Files tab, along with any include files.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://USER.pythonanywhere.com">https://USER.pythonanywhere.com</a>, enter your username and password and there&rsquo;s your beancount data on the web! If it doesn&rsquo;t work try reloading from the Web config page. If it still doesn&rsquo;t work, check all your files and variable names.</p>
<p><em>pythonanywhere does support SSL (https) but doesn&rsquo;t auto re-write so make sure you enter it into your browser.</em></p>
<h4 id="automagicness">Automagicness</h4>
<p>To get fava to update automatically we simple go to the Schedule tab in the pythonanywhere dashboard and add a time and link to the update script, /home/USER/update.sh. If you find you run out of CPU usage, disable this and just do it manually every so often. I&rsquo;d suggest setting the time to 23:55, so that way it runs and then your CPU limit gets reset at midnight.</p>
<p><img src="https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/schedule.PNG" alt="cron"></p>
<p>Now to automatically get your beancount file. I&rsquo;m going to assume you don&rsquo;t want to pay for pythonanywhere - as great as it is! I bring this up as it limits what methods you can push files to your account. SSH/rsync in or <strong>out</strong> of your account only work for paid accounts. If you do pay then you can setup a cron task on your home computer to push the file to your pythonanywhere account.</p>
<h5 id="rsync-paid-only">Rsync (paid only)</h5>
<p>I find having ssh config setup is useful to make rsync and ssh easier</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cat ~/.ssh/config

   HostName ssh.pythonanywhere.com
   port <span style="color:#ae81ff">12345</span>
   User your_pythonanywhere_user
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_SERVER1
</code></pre></div><p>Then add to your crontab with whatever frequency you&rsquo;d like e.g. once a day at 4 am:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">4</span> * * * rsync -avzhP -e ssh /file/path/on/home/beancount.file <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;pyanyw:/home/USER/beancount.file&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><h5 id="auto-sync">Auto sync</h5>
<p>Two methods I&rsquo;ve thought for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dropbox.
Turns out this won&rsquo;t work on pythonanywhere, looks like they <a href="https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/UsingDropbox">tried</a> but couldn&rsquo;t get it working. I use it as part of the rest of the whole finance system so would&rsquo;ve been nice to use it here. I left dropbox as an option in to point this out in case you were wondering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git / version control server
This is a great way as you have version control and can add a pull command in the update script. If you want to make changes on the server and push back, you&rsquo;d have to log into pythonanywhere and start a console to make a commit though. <a href="https://gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> does free private repos, and since writing this post originally I&rsquo;ve now setup a private gitlab repo.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s two things you need to setup to use your gitlab repo automatically:</p>
<h6 id="ssh-keys">SSH keys</h6>
<p><em>Actually this isn&rsquo;t needed if you only ever intend on pulling from gitlab. This is just so you can git push without needing your password.</em></p>
<p>This allows passwordless access to your repo, essential if you want to automate it. It&rsquo;s best to make a new key, something like id_gitlab.</p>
<p>Open a bash console on pytonanywhere:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;$your_email&quot;
</code></pre><p>Then add this key to the &lsquo;My SSH Keys&rsquo; section under the &lsquo;SSH&rsquo; tab in your user profile. Output it to the terminal with cat:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_gitlab.pub
</code></pre><p>Make sure it&rsquo;s the .pub one!</p>
<p>Now we need to make pythonanywhere know of this key in a ssh config file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cat ~/.ssh/config
Host gitlab.com
    RSAAuthentication yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_gitlab
    User mygitlabusername
</code></pre></div><h6 id="update-our-updatesh-script">Update our update.sh script</h6>
<p>Change the script to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># Update beancount file</span>
git -C money/ pull

<span style="color:#75715e"># Add user bin</span>
export PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>$PATH:/home/alexjj/.local/bin

<span style="color:#75715e"># Update fava</span>
pip3 install --user --upgrade beancount-fava

<span style="color:#75715e"># Reload web page</span>
touch /var/www/alexjj_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py
</code></pre></div><p>Now clone your gitlab repo, and update the update.sh and wsgi scripts to match your location. Restart the web server and now everything should be automatically updated and pulled daily!</p>
<p>Just to note that if you edit the beancount file in fava and save it, the git pull won&rsquo;t work as you&rsquo;ll have uncommitted changed. So either commit the changes, or revert them. I&rsquo;m considering setting up something to make it easier to commit changes, but I find I rarely want to add anything on fava as it involves too much typing compared to editing in spacemacs.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>
<p>Now you have the awesome fava tool to query, graph and analyse your data accessible from anywhere. If you have your own domain you can add a forwarding rule and point it at <a href="https://USER.pythonanywhere.com">https://USER.pythonanywhere.com</a> so you can go to myawesomemoneysite.com and there&rsquo;s your data.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest subscribing to the mailing lists, or at least favouriting them on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beancount">google groups</a>, join the irc channels and trying it all yourself.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have set this up and any improvements you&rsquo;ve made!</p>
