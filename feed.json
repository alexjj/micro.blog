				"title": "Changes to the Scottish Tax Bands",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Scotland&rsquo;s government has decided that from next year (from a tax perspective) they&rsquo;ll be adding <em>another</em> tax band to Scotland. A 45 per cent income tax band for earnings between £75,000 and £125,140. Plus fiddling with the ranges and percentages of the other bands.</p>\n<p>So from the 6th April 2024 these will be the rates:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Bands</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Band name</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Rate</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>£12,571 - £14,876</td>\n<td>Starter</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£14,877 - £26,561</td>\n<td>Basic</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£26,562 - £43,662</td>\n<td>Intermediate</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£43,663 - £74,999</td>\n<td>Higher</td>\n<td>42%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£75,000 - £125,140</td>\n<td>Advanced</td>\n<td>45%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Above £125,140</td>\n<td>Top</td>\n<td>48%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The current ones are:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Bands</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Band name</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Rate</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>£12,571 - £14,732</td>\n<td>Starter</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£14,733 - £25,688</td>\n<td>Basic</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£25,689 - £43,662</td>\n<td>Intermediate</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£75,000 - £125,140</td>\n<td>Higher</td>\n<td>42%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Above £125,140</td>\n<td>Top</td>\n<td>47%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The personal allowance (0%) remains the same at £12,570 (regardless of inflation, <strong>cough</strong> stealth tax <strong>cough</strong>) and the reduction of this between £100,000 to £125,140 by £1 for every £2.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m in the process of making myself a financial forecasting tool to figure out how much I should split between my ISA and pension, in the naive attempt to be financially independent by the time I&rsquo;m 50. The first part of that was making a function to calculate income tax, and whilst I was making it, I thought it might be interesting to see how these income tax changes impact everyone&rsquo;s salary, from £0 to £200k.</p>\n<p>For the record, here&rsquo;s England&rsquo;s tax bands:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Bands</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Band name</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Rate</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>£12,571 - £50,720</td>\n<td>Basic</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>£50,271 - £125,140</td>\n<td>Higher</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Above £125,140</td>\n<td>Additional</td>\n<td>45%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"the-code\">The Code</h2>\n<p>The personal allowance is a funny thing, and took me a while to figure out how to calculate it correctly.

				"content_text": "\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nScotland's government has decided that from next year (from a tax perspective) they'll be adding *another* tax band to Scotland. A 45 per cent income tax band for earnings between £75,000 and £125,140. Plus fiddling with the ranges and percentages of the other bands.\r\n\r\nSo from the 6th April 2024 these will be the rates:\r\n\r\n| **Bands**          | **Band name** | **Rate** |\r\n|--------------------|---------------|----------|\r\n| £12,571 - £14,876  | Starter       | 19%      |\r\n| £14,877 - £26,561  | Basic         | 20%      |\r\n| £26,562 - £43,662  | Intermediate  | 21%      |\r\n| £43,663 - £74,999  | Higher        | 42%      |\r\n| £75,000 - £125,140 | Advanced      | 45%      |\r\n| Above £125,140     | Top           | 48%      |\r\n\r\nThe current ones are:\r\n\r\n| **Bands**          | **Band name** | **Rate** |\r\n|--------------------|---------------|----------|\r\n| £12,571 - £14,732  | Starter       | 19%      |\r\n| £14,733 - £25,688  | Basic         | 20%      |\r\n| £25,689 - £43,662  | Intermediate  | 21%      |\r\n| £75,000 - £125,140 | Higher        | 42%      |\r\n| Above £125,140     | Top           | 47%      |\r\n\r\nThe personal allowance (0%) remains the same at £12,570 (regardless of inflation, **cough** stealth tax **cough**) and the reduction of this between £100,000 to £125,140 by £1 for every £2.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of making myself a financial forecasting tool to figure out how much I should split between my ISA and pension, in the naive attempt to be financially independent by the time I'm 50. The first part of that was making a function to calculate income tax, and whilst I was making it, I thought it might be interesting to see how these income tax changes impact everyone's salary, from £0 to £200k.\r\n\r\nFor the record, here's England's tax bands:\r\n\r\n| **Bands**          | **Band name** | **Rate** |\r\n|--------------------|---------------|----------|\r\n| £12,571 - £50,720  | Basic         | 20%      |\r\n| £50,271 - £125,140 | Higher        | 40%      |\r\n| Above £125,140     | Additional    | 45%      |\r\n\r\n## The Code\r\n\r\nThe personal allowance is a funny thing, and took me a while to figure out how to calculate it correctly. Working this out is not a new problem so I looked on Github and it seemed people either did a whole load of `if` statements or some clever but unintelligible (by me at least) [numpy matrix math](https://github.com/HJEGeorge/tax_calculator/blob/master/tax_tools.py#L178).\r\n\r\nThe best way I found to understand it and calculate it such that I could pass various bands and percentages, was to remove the personal allowance from your income and the tax bands that were under £100k, in something that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef calculate_scottish_income_tax(income, bands, rates, allowance=12570):\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Initialize tax and income variables\r\n    personal_allowance = calc_personal_allowance(income)\r\n    tax_due = 0\r\n    remaining_income = income - personal_allowance\r\n\r\n    post_pa_bands = [item - (allowance - personal_allowance) if item < 125140 else item for item in bands]\r\n\r\n    # Calculate tax for each band\r\n    for i in range(len(bands)):\r\n        if remaining_income <= 0:\r\n            break\r\n\r\n        # Determine the taxable amount in the current band\r\n        taxable_amount = min(remaining_income, post_pa_bands[i+1] - post_pa_bands[i])\r\n\r\n        # Calculate tax for the current band\r\n        tax_due += taxable_amount * rates[i]\r\n\r\n        # Update remaining income\r\n        remaining_income -= taxable_amount\r\n\r\n    return tax_due\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd also created a function to determine the personal allowance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef calc_personal_allowance(income, allowance=12570, threshold=100000):\r\n  return min(allowance, max(allowance-(income-threshold)/2,0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy function takes a list of the bands and percentages. As I couldn't think of another way to do it whilst keeping it simple I just add a trillion pounds to the upper end of the bands. A trillion isn't entirely necessary, but I figured it should cover most of the population.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nbands_23_24 = [12570, 14732, 25688, 43662, 125140, 1e9]\r\nrates_23_24 = [0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.42, 0.47]\r\n\r\nbands_24_25 = [12570, 14876, 26561, 43662, 75000, 125140, 1e9]\r\nrates_24_25 = [0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.42, 0.45, 0.48]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's do a few tests:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nincome = 100000\r\n\r\ntax_2324 = calculate_scottish_income_tax(income, bands_23_24, rates_23_24)\r\ntax_2425 = calculate_scottish_income_tax(income, bands_24_25, rates_24_25)\r\n\r\nprint(f\"Income of £{income} paid £{tax_2324} last year and £{tax_2425} this year\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nIncome of £100000 paid £30038.48 last year and £30778.309999999998 this year\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, it's gone up, but what about everyone else?\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nTime to see what's happened across the spectrum for 99.9999% of the population.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_values = np.arange(0, 200001, 1000)\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Income': x_values})\r\ndf['Tax 2023/2024'] = df['Income'].apply(lambda x: calculate_scottish_income_tax(x, bands_23_24, rates_23_24))\r\ndf['Tax 2024/2025'] = df['Income'].apply(lambda x: calculate_scottish_income_tax(x, bands_24_25, rates_24_25))\r\ndf['Change'] = df['Tax 2024/2025'] - df['Tax 2023/2024']\r\ndf = df.round(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Compare the bands](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/956aedb62b.jpg \"Comparing the bands\")\r\n\r\nObviously above £75k it has changed, but actually at the lower amounts it has changed too. Generally, slightly better as the band ranges have changed. Although if you earn £15k a year, I'm not sure how much you'll notice the £1.44 extra, given the double digit inflation and Brexit consequences.\r\n\r\nCheck out that steep gradient between £100k and £125k, the loss of the personal allowance makes it a very high marginal rate of tax.\r\n\r\nLet's just have a look at the change between them to make it more obvious.\r\n\r\n![Delta between tax years](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/a26060e8c3.jpg \"Delta between tax years\")\r\n\r\nThe [median earnings in Scotland](https://digitalpublications.parliament.scot/ResearchBriefings/Report/2023/2/27/e0888682-8f9a-46f0-9448-5a588c583f58) is £27,710, so how does that person fair? Well as I've already alluded to, they are better off...by £10.17 a year. (Final tax home pay will of course depend on lots of things, including national insurance, which I've not got to yet).\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWithout getting too political, there are the numbers. Make of it what you will. Here's England vs. the new Scottish bands.\r\n\r\n![Delta between Scotland and England](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/080e2af6ea.jpg \"Delta between Scotland and England]\")\r\n\r\nThe graph doesn't win awards for comprehension, so the hint is, Scotland costs more. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿\r\n",

Thought I&rsquo;d join in.</p>\n<p>I really don&rsquo;t like subscriptions, and would much rather pay once and be done with it. Once you join and commit, they have you, it can be hard to leave. The upside is that if you don&rsquo;t like it, it&rsquo;s minimal expense to stop. Photoshop used to be hundreds of pounds but now it&rsquo;s just ten. Of course in those days, 30 day demos or similar were common. Anyway here goes (Monthly prices):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Prime - £95 per year (£7.92 per month)</li>\n<li>Netflix - £16 increasing to £18. We have premium to get downloads on more than two devices.</li>\n<li>TV licence - £13.25. Required to watch BBC, even via iPlayer. A weird one.</li>\n<li>Spotify - £10.99. Currently just premium for my wife, but we have had the family one in the past.</li>\n<li>Apple iCloud 50 GB - £0.99</li>\n<li>HP instant ink - £4.49. This is for 100 pages a month. I could probably drop down a level, we had a brief patch of printing a lot but think that&rsquo;s past. £2.99 gives 50 pages a month.</li>\n<li>Domains - I&rsquo;ve seem to have spent £75 (£6.25/m) this year on six domains. Can definitely cancel one and I should investigate transferring them elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Liteserver VPS - €26.40 per year (£1.93 /m). A Black Friday deal. Might see what they have again this year and transfer if it&rsquo;s cheaper. Although less hassle just to stay</li>\n<li>MXRoute email hosting - $5 per year (£0.25/m). Another Black Friday deal from years and years ago. I just keep it as it couldn&rsquo;t be matched again. Don&rsquo;t even use it though&hellip;</li>\n<li>Two SIM only phone contracts for us - £8/m each. Usually sign up for another deal each year to reset the price.</li>\n<li>Tesco delivery saver - Currently about £0.20 per month but only as we used clubcard points to buy vouchers for this. It&rsquo;s £29.94 for 6 months of offpeak delivery.</li>\n<li>Amazon kids+ - £38 per year (£3.17/m). Did get last year on a promo for £20 but haven&rsquo;t seen any recently. We have two Kindle fires which the kids play on and having access to everything is pretty good. They&rsquo;ve got a lot of use out of it. If I can find another promo that would be good, although the annual fee just hit recently so maybe not much scope in the near term.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Total: £83.44 per month</p>\n<p>That includes netflix increase, which will put it at 22% of the total, with TV licence next.</p>\n<p>Other subscription services we use but only when free, generally via promos:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple music</li>\n<li>Apple TV</li>\n<li>Disney+</li>\n<li>Oracle free VPS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I debate about getting Apple One for 2TB of storage, music, TV, and to some extent apps. The kindle fires are ancient, and were $20 refurbs from 2018, but still going. However, at some stage I suspect they&rsquo;ll die and we probably won&rsquo;t replace them, but rather we&rsquo;ll have enough hand-me-down iPads to take their place. This plus the likeihood our eldest will get a phone next year means that the free apps might be useful. The 2 TB of storage would be nice to then backup all my photos into Photos.app and enjoy the benefit of that. TV is nice add-on, which I wouldn&rsquo;t pay for separately. Music would be great if we could leave Spotify. We think Spotify is a better app to use, and works much better with streaming to our house speakers (powered by Google Chromecast audio). Better off paying for family spotify as I think everyone would rather have it. This just then makes Apple One not that worthwhile. If I want the photos back up then I should just pay the £7/m for the storage.</p>\n<p>My wife does have yoga apps she subscribes to, not sure the current status of those but likely paid annually, and maybe there are some other annual things lurking that I&rsquo;ve forgotten about.</p>\n<p>So not too bad overall. I keep thinking about raising the subject of cancelling Netflix but it does get watched a lot by everyone.</p>\n",

The upside is that if you don't like it, it's minimal expense to stop. Photoshop used to be hundreds of pounds but now it's just ten. Of course in those days, 30 day demos or similar were common. Anyway here goes (Monthly prices):\r\n\r\n* Amazon Prime - £95 per year (£7.92 per month)\r\n* Netflix - £16 increasing to £18. We have premium to get downloads on more than two devices.\r\n* TV licence - £13.25. Required to watch BBC, even via iPlayer. A weird one.\r\n* Spotify - £10.99. Currently just premium for my wife, but we have had the family one in the past.\r\n* Apple iCloud 50 GB - £0.99\r\n* HP instant ink - £4.49. This is for 100 pages a month. I could probably drop down a level, we had a brief patch of printing a lot but think that's past. £2.99 gives 50 pages a month.\r\n* Domains - I've seem to have spent £75 (£6.25/m) this year on six domains. Can definitely cancel one and I should investigate transferring them elsewhere.\r\n* Liteserver VPS - €26.40 per year (£1.93 /m). A Black Friday deal. Might see what they have again this year and transfer if it's cheaper. Although less hassle just to stay\r\n* MXRoute email hosting - $5 per year (£0.25/m). Another Black Friday deal from years and years ago. I just keep it as it couldn't be matched again. Don't even use it though...\r\n* Two SIM only phone contracts for us - £8/m each. Usually sign up for another deal each year to reset the price.\r\n* Tesco delivery saver - Currently about £0.20 per month but only as we used clubcard points to buy vouchers for this. It's £29.94 for 6 months of offpeak delivery.\r\n* Amazon kids+ - £38 per year (£3.17/m). Did get last year on a promo for £20 but haven't seen any recently. We have two Kindle fires which the kids play on and having access to everything is pretty good. They've got a lot of use out of it. If I can find another promo that would be good, although the annual fee just hit recently so maybe not much scope in the near term.\r\n\r\nTotal: £83.44 per month\r\n\r\nThat includes netflix increase, which will put it at 22% of the total, with TV licence next.\r\n\r\nOther subscription services we use but only when free, generally via promos:\r\n\r\n* Apple music\r\n* Apple TV\r\n* Disney+\r\n* Oracle free VPS\r\n\r\nI debate about getting Apple One for 2TB of storage, music, TV, and to some extent apps. The kindle fires are ancient, and were $20 refurbs from 2018, but still going. However, at some stage I suspect they'll die and we probably won't replace them, but rather we'll have enough hand-me-down iPads to take their place. This plus the likeihood our eldest will get a phone next year means that the free apps might be useful. The 2 TB of storage would be nice to then backup all my photos into Photos.app and enjoy the benefit of that. TV is nice add-on, which I wouldn't pay for separately. Music would be great if we could leave Spotify. We think Spotify is a better app to use, and works much better with streaming to our house speakers (powered by Google Chromecast audio). Better off paying for family spotify as I think everyone would rather have it. This just then makes Apple One not that worthwhile. If I want the photos back up then I should just pay the £7/m for the storage.\r\n\r\nMy wife does have yoga apps she subscribes to, not sure the current status of those but likely paid annually, and maybe there are some other annual things lurking that I've forgotten about.\r\n\r\nSo not too bad overall. I keep thinking about raising the subject of cancelling Netflix but it does get watched a lot by everyone.\r\n",

I don&rsquo;t remember why I started on this, but it seemed like something I&rsquo;d enjoy and be interested in. I didn&rsquo;t end up doing anything, as you had to sit exams at test centres and it wasn&rsquo;t convenient. I soon forgot about it and did nothing more. Last summer, the same thoughts occurred to me again, not sure why, but I started looking into radio. This time what it takes to be licenced in the UK.</p>\n<p>All that resulted in passing my foundation licence in December 2022 in the online exams by the <a href=\"https://rsgb.org/\">RSGB</a>. I&rsquo;d spoken to a friend about it in the summer, and he got interested. We both did the Essexham foundation training course, which runs online for a few weeks. He ended up passing first, which encouraged me to get on with booking my exam.</p>\n<p>The content isn&rsquo;t difficult, but there&rsquo;s a lot of specific things you just need to remember. The exams &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have trick questions&rdquo; but often have word games or a particular way of asking questions which can make them harder than you&rsquo;d think. I probably should&rsquo;ve read the foundation manual as well.</p>\n<p>It took until January before I actually got my licene from ofcom, the postal strikes and christmas holidays meant it took a while. I then got to pick my callsign online. There weren&rsquo;t many options to pick from and so ended up with something that, to me, sounded reasonable - MM7RVP. My callsign is M7RVP, but being in Scotland means I have to put in the other M. People in England don&rsquo;t have to use any letters (except for intermediate licence), which is a little annoying but I suppose the UK couldn&rsquo;t have too many designated letters.</p>\n<p>I then did nothing for 4 months. Well, not nothing but I didn&rsquo;t use my callsign on the air. I mostly debated what I wanted to buy - if anything. Radio transceivers (transmitters and receivers in one) aren&rsquo;t that cheap. Probably not a high volume electronics item like computers and TVs, so are still pricey. Used gear is cheaper but after the initial depreciation, they then to hold their prices well. My friend and I were in the same boat, what do we get, is it worth it etc. He did buy a VHF/UHF setup, which is good for local contacts, but what&rsquo;s the most fun is HF. HF is the frequency range (3-30 MHz) that can go all around the world in the ionosphere.</p>\n<p>Like most electronic things, there is no one perfect device. Perhaps the £10,000 one could be classed as that, but it&rsquo;s £10k and therefore not perfect 😅. We both had a similar shortlist of radios and spent many evenings debating the trade offs of them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/b7aa4727d0.jpg\" alt=\"My first radio: Xiegu G90\" title=\"My first radio: Xiegu G90\"></p>\n<p>One day I saw one on the UK&rsquo;s used <a href=\"https://www.hamradiodeals.co.uk/\">ham radio forum</a>, and that sold it for me. It was in great condition and I could easily sell it for what I paid for it, £350, if I needed to. I bought a Xiegu G90. This is a chinese brand radio, has a small but usable screen with a waterfall and does 20W on the HF bands. My foundation licence only allows 10W so it&rsquo;s ideal. I was all sorted. Well&hellip;with a radio, I still needed an antenna.</p>\n<p>Picking a radio is very easy in comparison to picking an antenna. I think you never really pick one, you just make one, try it, and then make more and try them. Maybe you find some are better than others, or maybe they&rsquo;re just different. I don&rsquo;t know yet, as I&rsquo;ve only had one so far but picking that was tricky.</p>\n<p>There are so many factors in picking an antenna, and it really depends on the space you have and what you&rsquo;re willing to do. My aim was easy to install and would be decent enough to get me going.</p>\n<p>To cut a long story short, I went with what&rsquo;s called an end fed half wave (EFHW) antenna, for the 40m band and up, making it 20m of wire. It works well on many bands, and the internal tuner on the Xiegu even gets a couple of others out of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/c38b1e4d6b.jpg\" alt=\"Ready to put up the antenna\" title=\"Ready to put up the antenna\"></p>\n<p>Armed with a big mug of tea, I was ready to put up the antenna. I would attach to the balcony on the first floor, and to a pole at the end of the garden. Or so I planned. Turned out the pole I bought was quite weak and bendy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3867772c7d.jpg\" alt=\"A bit too bendy\" title=\"A bit too bendy\"></p>\n<p>The pole is 6 m tall but with the flex, the antenna was only about 3-3.5m off the ground. (I later read it would be better to thread it through a loop on the pole and tie it off on the ground, so that the pole wasn&rsquo;t taking the full horizontal force. I did try that, but it wasn&rsquo;t much better.)</p>\n<p>I thought I could raise it up by tying the pole to the nearby tree - this tree is unfortunately still quite small else I&rsquo;d have used it in the first place.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/dea4e6af1b.jpg\" alt=\"Oh Dear&hellip;\" title=\"Oh Dear...\"></p>\n<p>A little too much force it seems&hellip;I took down the pole and ended up tying the antenna to the tree, whilst the tree is small it could still hold the weight of the line and I could get it moderately high. I ordered a space section, so the pole will be for a portable setup that I&rsquo;ll make one day.</p>\n<p>The antenna is about 4m off the ground at the house end and almost 3 at the tree end. Not the greatest but will do. The closer it is to the ground the more signal is absorbed by the ground and the higher the remaining signal gets sent into the air. This isn&rsquo;t great for long distance as a lot of the signal will get lost or only do one bounce in the atmosphere. However, to get it higher I&rsquo;ll need some serious pole solution.</p>\n<p>So how has it been? Pretty fun! I&rsquo;ve spoken to people all over Europe, into Canada and the USA. I can often hear signals from all around the world - Falklands, Australia, Japan, Indonesia, South Africa, etc. - but they can&rsquo;t hear me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4f5a932266.jpg\" alt=\"Voice Contacts Made\" title=\"Voice Contacts Made\"></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve used the digital mode, FT8, which means I connect my computer to the radio and it communicates with other computers via radio. This doesn&rsquo;t need nearly as much signal compared to noise to make a contact compared to voice contacts. The best part is that you can look up online (on <a href=\"https://pskreporter.info/\">PSK Reporter</a>) who has heard your signal. So you don&rsquo;t need to make a contact with them to know how far your signal has gone. I&rsquo;ve been heard across the world with this, and have made real contacts with Australia, Brazil and Japan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3a99c21b17.jpg\" alt=\"Who&rsquo;s heard me? The pins with times are who has\" title=\"Who's heard me? The pins with times are who has\"></p>\n<p>Digital is nice to do whilst doing something else on the computer, and it is fun when you see someone far away has heard you, but by far the most fun is talking to people. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a quick signal report and move on, and other times we get into chats about gear (most often) and local things going on. Often I&rsquo;ll listen to others chatting and enjoy that just as much. Each evening you go on, you never know who&rsquo;s going to be there and who&rsquo;s going to hear you (the signal propagation relies on solar activity and is different each day on each band). I could (and have!) spend hours on the radio. So much so that I&rsquo;ve not had time to do anything else - no photography, no blog posts, not finished the mac mini G3 build, and probably plenty of other things.</p>\n<p>I did manage to tear myself away from the radio to study for the intermediate licence - this is the next level in the UK system and lets me use 50W and a few more bands. I passed this a few weeks ago, and so have a new callsign, 2M0RVM. It takes a while to get used to saying the new sign and sometimes I mix up the old and new, especially the RVP vs RVM. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve picked something completely different but I liked the sound of RVM, and finding a free one is tricky, there isn&rsquo;t an up to date list anywhere (even the last freedom of information request list from January 2023 was significantly out of date).</p>\n<p>Now I&rsquo;m debating the antenna situation. Pole or not, a vertical, something else. My wife isn&rsquo;t keen on the wire going across the garden but equally doesn&rsquo;t like the sound of a 10m pole! I have started to look into satellites too, at least a dish is more discrete. I&rsquo;m also thinking of setting up a portable antenna for trips away.</p>\n<p>Plus I have the full licence still to get. 📚 (Update July 2023: I&rsquo;m now a full holder!)</p>\n<p>Look me up on <a href=\"https://www.qrz.com/db/GM5ALX\">QRZ</a>.</p>\n",

The pins with times are who has\")\r\n\r\nDigital is nice to do whilst doing something else on the computer, and it is fun when you see someone far away has heard you, but by far the most fun is talking to people. Sometimes it's a quick signal report and move on, and other times we get into chats about gear (most often) and local things going on. Often I'll listen to others chatting and enjoy that just as much. Each evening you go on, you never know who's going to be there and who's going to hear you (the signal propagation relies on solar activity and is different each day on each band). I could (and have!) spend hours on the radio. So much so that I've not had time to do anything else - no photography, no blog posts, not finished the mac mini G3 build, and probably plenty of other things.\r\n\r\nI did manage to tear myself away from the radio to study for the intermediate licence - this is the next level in the UK system and lets me use 50W and a few more bands. I passed this a few weeks ago, and so have a new callsign, 2M0RVM. It takes a while to get used to saying the new sign and sometimes I mix up the old and new, especially the RVP vs RVM. Maybe I should've picked something completely different but I liked the sound of RVM, and finding a free one is tricky, there isn't an up to date list anywhere (even the last freedom of information request list from January 2023 was significantly out of date).\r\n\r\nNow I'm debating the antenna situation. Pole or not, a vertical, something else. My wife isn't keen on the wire going across the garden but equally doesn't like the sound of a 10m pole! I have started to look into satellites too, at least a dish is more discrete. I'm also thinking of setting up a portable antenna for trips away.\r\n\r\nPlus I have the full licence still to get. 📚 (Update July 2023: I'm now a full holder!)\r\n\r\nLook me up on [QRZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/GM5ALX).\r\n",

So for portraits - where people are standing still - the 60mm is probably better. It&rsquo;s also of the old, original set of Fuji lenses (along with the <a href=\"/2022/new-fuji-lens/\">35mm f/1.4</a> and the 56 f/1.2), which means it has a slightly different look than the modern ones. Good or bad? That&rsquo;s personal preference. I certainly like the 35mm one.</p>\n<p>f/2.4 vs f/2 is not really much different, although I&rsquo;ve not done sharpness tests etc., for that you&rsquo;ll have to look elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The obvious difference is that the 60mm has close focus for macro - this was the very reason I bought it. I&rsquo;m not sure 60mm is a great macro length and it&rsquo;s not a perfect 1:1 macro, so YMMV. I&rsquo;m thinking about replacing mine as for film scanning I can&rsquo;t make use of the full sensor area with this lens, so seems like a waste.</p>\n<p>Speaking of focusing&hellip;oh my, how the 60mm is slow compared to the 50mm. It&rsquo;s not super slow, and perfectly usable even for kids running around but it&rsquo;s not the 🫰 and you&rsquo;re there focus of the 50mm. Having said that, the 50mm often missed focus on kids running around so not perfect either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I sold the 50mm and kept the 60mm. I need the macro (unless I change my mind on the camera scanning solution) and I don&rsquo;t often like shooting at longer lengths and I rarely/never do portrait sessions, so the 50mm doesn&rsquo;t make much sense. Plus if I did do portraits, I could use the 60mm and it would be fine.</p>\n<p>I actually have the 60mm for sale, with the intent to replace it with a better macro. There are various 3rd party manual focus macros which are much better and would be ideal for film scanning. Although I&rsquo;m also tempted to abandon film scanning with my camera and just buy a dedicated 35mm scanner like the Plusteks. I used to own one but sold it and now I regret that. Whilst they&rsquo;re slow to scan, everything is right there and easy to do. If the 60mm ever sells then I&rsquo;ll decide what I&rsquo;ll do.</p>\n",

So for portraits - where people are standing still - the 60mm is probably better. It's also of the old, original set of Fuji lenses (along with the [35mm f/1.4](/2022/new-fuji-lens/) and the 56 f/1.2), which means it has a slightly different look than the modern ones. Good or bad? That's personal preference. I certainly like the 35mm one.\r\n\r\nf/2.4 vs f/2 is not really much different, although I've not done sharpness tests etc., for that you'll have to look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe obvious difference is that the 60mm has close focus for macro - this was the very reason I bought it. I'm not sure 60mm is a great macro length and it's not a perfect 1:1 macro, so YMMV. I'm thinking about replacing mine as for film scanning I can't make use of the full sensor area with this lens, so seems like a waste.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of focusing...oh my, how the 60mm is slow compared to the 50mm. It's not super slow, and perfectly usable even for kids running around but it's not the 🫰 and you're there focus of the 50mm. Having said that, the 50mm often missed focus on kids running around so not perfect either.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI sold the 50mm and kept the 60mm. I need the macro (unless I change my mind on the camera scanning solution) and I don't often like shooting at longer lengths and I rarely/never do portrait sessions, so the 50mm doesn't make much sense. Plus if I did do portraits, I could use the 60mm and it would be fine.\r\n\r\nI actually have the 60mm for sale, with the intent to replace it with a better macro. There are various 3rd party manual focus macros which are much better and would be ideal for film scanning. Although I'm also tempted to abandon film scanning with my camera and just buy a dedicated 35mm scanner like the Plusteks. I used to own one but sold it and now I regret that. Whilst they're slow to scan, everything is right there and easy to do. If the 60mm ever sells then I'll decide what I'll do.\r\n",

I tried not to but the macro lens was never going to be cheap. I went for the Fuji 60mm f/2.4 as I thought it would also be useful as a mid-range portrait lens. I&rsquo;ve never used it for that but I still might. However, having used it for scanning I&rsquo;m not sure I like it for that. I&rsquo;ve found manual focus is more reliable and helps speed up the process once it&rsquo;s dialled in and the 60mm&rsquo;s focus by wire isn&rsquo;t that great.

Space and expansion obviously aligns with the size, but if you just need laptop innards but in a desktop then the tiny models are great.

Generally these are designed for businesses and as such graphics performance tends to be poor for gaming or ML /GPU intensive work.

Expansion of these machines tends to be quite limited. This is of course dependant on your perspective. As you can still get 64GB of ram and 1-3 storage devices (NVME, SSD, HDD), and a PCI-E expansion card (depending on the model). So be sure to know what you want before you buy it, as it&rsquo;s not as flexible as a regular desktop. Little things like using special power supply connectors on the motherboard means you can&rsquo;t put in a new PSU to enable running a bigger GPU, or some SATA slots are weirdly slow as they&rsquo;re only meant for DVD drives. There aren&rsquo;t extra SATA power cables for another drive, even if you could stick it somewhere.

				"content_html": "<p>After the previous attempt, where I concluded the developer had expired, I was determined to continue. First I had to purchase some new developer. I decided to go for Kodak HC-110. This appears to be a classic developer from the beginning of time and it&rsquo;s high dilution ratio and long shelf life attracted me to it. Initially, I thought it was more expensive than the Ilford ilfosol 3, but that&rsquo;s because I didn&rsquo;t notice I was buying 1 litre of HC-110 vs. the 500 ml of ilfosol (the pictures are the same size on the website 😅), and even with that obvious difference the dilution means the HC-110 wins out. I also took the opportunity to get some photoflo - this helps avoid water marks. Hydrophobic solution or some such. I found water marks and drying a pain when doing 4x5. The 35mm is a lot smaller but one less thing to deal with is always nice. The HC-110 does have a lot of warning labels on it, much more so than the Ilford. Perhaps that&rsquo;s just for the US market or perhaps it really is much worse for the environment? The whole development process does seem to be not great for the environment, I feel like I use a <strong>lot</strong> of water. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s ways to improve this and I&rsquo;ll look into it more.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/0e1e9e080c.jpg\" alt=\"New chemicals\" title=\"New chemicals\"></p>\n<p>Last time I had to figure out how to open the canister without a fancy tool, and so this time I got straight in and ripped it open like a hungry bear opening a dumpster lid. However, this time it took me <em>forever</em> to get the film onto the plastic development spool. Literally 45 minutes. I was tucked into my dark bag, absolutely sweating, fiddling about trying to get it on and to take. Once it did go but then seem to get stuck half way and wouldn&rsquo;t go any further. I had to then unwind it and start all over again 😢. My wife was out and I daren&rsquo;t take my arms out of the dark bag whilst the film was completely exposed inside, and I was wishing I&rsquo;d setup my iPad or phone next to me so I could try and get Siri to start playing a video of loading a spool. But then somehow it just worked. It wasn&rsquo;t perfect, the last little bit didn&rsquo;t quite seem to go on, and so I tucked it in myself. Phew&hellip;all loaded, and now I could start the actual development! Seems like not perfectly dry plastic spools can have this issue. Although does make me interested in <a href=\"https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/products/lab-box-the-35mm-daylight-loading-film-tank\">stuff like this</a>. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1SGQQwNXQ\">Video explainer.</a></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve made a <a href=\"/notes/film\">permanent place now</a> to write my instructions so I won&rsquo;t forget, but doing it in practice is quite different from reading about it. I used a tiny measuring cylinder for the HC-110, but then rinsing the developer into the larger measuring cylinder was a bit of a hassle, I might use a syringe next time. I&rsquo;d made up all the stocks. I am using a stop chemical - people tell me they just use water, and probably I will in the future - but as I have it and it&rsquo;s getting a bit old I might as well use it up. I&rsquo;d bought some new fixer as well. The Ilford one I have as expired according to the label and so I didn&rsquo;t want something else ruining it. The Adox one gives you a choice of dilution and seemingly it just means you wait longer&hellip;so why wouldn&rsquo;t I go for the more dilute one?</p>\n<p>The stop and the developer are both this pale yellow colour when made up, and I&rsquo;d placed them in the order I&rsquo;d use them on the side of the sink. I&rsquo;d also put a thermometer into the developer to stir it and see what the temperature was - seems our utility is a bit colder than the rest of the house and was only at 18 °C. However, what I hadn&rsquo;t noticed was that my labelled measuring cylinders were the wrong way round - I have one I&rsquo;ve written &lsquo;dev&rsquo; on and one with &lsquo;stop&rsquo; on (also one with &lsquo;fix&rsquo;). I&rsquo;d made up the solution into the wrong one! Not a super big deal but after I&rsquo;d poured in the developer I noticed and then that got me doubting I knew exactly which was which! If I was really worried, I could&rsquo;ve poured it out, washed a lot and then started again. However, I was fairly confident because of the thermometer&hellip;</p>\n<p>Time past, agitation was applied, and then the gallons of water was washed over the film. I dipped the spool in the photoflo (that&rsquo;ll last ages as 200:1 dilution! aka a drop), and then lifted it out to see what happened&hellip;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/7bb4e748b0.jpg\" alt=\"Success!\" title=\"Success!\"></p>\n<p>I was overjoyed to see the development had worked. No blank or black or something film, just lovely little 35mm frames all the way along. In my excitement I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to how I was cutting them up, and instead of strips of 6 it was all over the place with 4, 6, 8&hellip;all sorts! The photoflo seemed to work well as the water just ran right off them whilst hanging up to dry.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4779836024.jpg\" alt=\"Drying nicely\" title=\"Drying nicely\"></p>\n<p>So that was yesterday, and by the time it was all done, it was time for bed! Now the next mammoth effort, which is scanning them in. I think I have everything I need, although still deciding upon what software to use. Everyone seems to love negative lab pro, and I&rsquo;ve downloaded the free trial to test it out. It&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s another $100 on something. All this stuff&hellip;there are lots of free things, or just instructions for Lightroom, and the open source editors like GIMP or Darktable all do it to some degree. What I would really like to do is make a contact sheet, just so I can look at them quickly and see what&rsquo;s what. I had a quick mess about with the Film Dev app on iOS and laying a couple of strips on my light box. That actually works out pretty well just to see what you have. I could do with a holder or a transparent storage sleeve to hold them in. Annoyingly I just bought some 35mm storage sleeves two days ago, but I&rsquo;d just gone for ones with opaque tracing paper style back, mostly as that&rsquo;s what came up first and I have them already from films done by the lab. Now I see there are just as many transparent ones, which are probably more useful to have in the long run for going back through all photos. Even more annoyingly is that they went up in price on Amazon TODAY! Only a couple of quid, but still it&rsquo;s yet another thing to buy 😅. Here&rsquo;s the quick shot I did, mostly pick the strips at random but I quite like the four slide montage of individuals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/bd403ac86b.jpg\" alt=\"Quick scan with phone\"></p>\n<p>It was quite an ordeal but makes the photos all the more enjoyable. All in all, I&rsquo;m very happy with it. I&rsquo;ll get to scanning them all at some point but I&rsquo;m happy not to send B&amp;W away to the lab now (although I still will for colour). Am I now going to be 100% film, and blasting through multiple rolls a day&hellip;probably not, but now I won&rsquo;t think quite so hard as to whether whatever we&rsquo;re doing is enough to justify a roll of film.</p>\n",

The 35mm is a lot smaller but one less thing to deal with is always nice. The HC-110 does have a lot of warning labels on it, much more so than the Ilford. Perhaps that's just for the US market or perhaps it really is much worse for the environment? The whole development process does seem to be not great for the environment, I feel like I use a **lot** of water. I'm sure there's ways to improve this and I'll look into it more.\r\n\r\n![New chemicals](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/0e1e9e080c.jpg \"New chemicals\")\r\n\r\nLast time I had to figure out how to open the canister without a fancy tool, and so this time I got straight in and ripped it open like a hungry bear opening a dumpster lid. However, this time it took me *forever* to get the film onto the plastic development spool. Literally 45 minutes. I was tucked into my dark bag, absolutely sweating, fiddling about trying to get it on and to take. Once it did go but then seem to get stuck half way and wouldn't go any further. I had to then unwind it and start all over again 😢. My wife was out and I daren't take my arms out of the dark bag whilst the film was completely exposed inside, and I was wishing I'd setup my iPad or phone next to me so I could try and get Siri to start playing a video of loading a spool. But then somehow it just worked. It wasn't perfect, the last little bit didn't quite seem to go on, and so I tucked it in myself. Phew...all loaded, and now I could start the actual development! Seems like not perfectly dry plastic spools can have this issue. Although does make me interested in [stuff like this](https://analoguewonderland.co.uk/products/lab-box-the-35mm-daylight-loading-film-tank). [Video explainer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa1SGQQwNXQ)\r\n\r\nI've made a [permanent place now](/notes/film) to write my instructions so I won't forget, but doing it in practice is quite different from reading about it. I used a tiny measuring cylinder for the HC-110, but then rinsing the developer into the larger measuring cylinder was a bit of a hassle, I might use a syringe next time. I'd made up all the stocks. I am using a stop chemical - people tell me they just use water, and probably I will in the future - but as I have it and it's getting a bit old I might as well use it up. I'd bought some new fixer as well. The Ilford one I have as expired according to the label and so I didn't want something else ruining it. The Adox one gives you a choice of dilution and seemingly it just means you wait longer...so why wouldn't I go for the more dilute one?\r\n\r\nThe stop and the developer are both this pale yellow colour when made up, and I'd placed them in the order I'd use them on the side of the sink. I'd also put a thermometer into the developer to stir it and see what the temperature was - seems our utility is a bit colder than the rest of the house and was only at 18 °C. However, what I hadn't noticed was that my labelled measuring cylinders were the wrong way round - I have one I've written 'dev' on and one with 'stop' on (also one with 'fix'). I'd made up the solution into the wrong one! Not a super big deal but after I'd poured in the developer I noticed and then that got me doubting I knew exactly which was which! If I was really worried, I could've poured it out, washed a lot and then started again. However, I was fairly confident because of the thermometer...\r\n\r\nTime past, agitation was applied, and then the gallons of water was washed over the film. I dipped the spool in the photoflo (that'll last ages as 200:1 dilution! aka a drop), and then lifted it out to see what happened...\r\n\r\n![Success!](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/7bb4e748b0.jpg \"Success!\")\r\n\r\nI was overjoyed to see the development had worked. No blank or black or something film, just lovely little 35mm frames all the way along. In my excitement I wasn't paying attention to how I was cutting them up, and instead of strips of 6 it was all over the place with 4, 6, 8...all sorts! The photoflo seemed to work well as the water just ran right off them whilst hanging up to dry.\r\n\r\n![Drying nicely](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/4779836024.jpg \"Drying nicely\")\r\n\r\nSo that was yesterday, and by the time it was all done, it was time for bed! Now the next mammoth effort, which is scanning them in. I think I have everything I need, although still deciding upon what software to use. Everyone seems to love negative lab pro, and I've downloaded the free trial to test it out. It's just that it's another $100 on something. All this stuff...there are lots of free things, or just instructions for Lightroom, and the open source editors like GIMP or Darktable all do it to some degree. What I would really like to do is make a contact sheet, just so I can look at them quickly and see what's what. I had a quick mess about with the Film Dev app on iOS and laying a couple of strips on my light box. That actually works out pretty well just to see what you have. I could do with a holder or a transparent storage sleeve to hold them in. Annoyingly I just bought some 35mm storage sleeves two days ago, but I'd just gone for ones with opaque tracing paper style back, mostly as that's what came up first and I have them already from films done by the lab. Now I see there are just as many transparent ones, which are probably more useful to have in the long run for going back through all photos. Even more annoyingly is that they went up in price on Amazon TODAY! Only a couple of quid, but still it's yet another thing to buy 😅. Here's the quick shot I did, mostly pick the strips at random but I quite like the four slide montage of individuals.\r\n\r\n![Quick scan with phone](https://fondoftea.micro.blog/uploads/2025/bd403ac86b.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt was quite an ordeal but makes the photos all the more enjoyable. All in all, I'm very happy with it. I'll get to scanning them all at some point but I'm happy not to send B&W away to the lab now (although I still will for colour). Am I now going to be 100% film, and blasting through multiple rolls a day...probably not, but now I won't think quite so hard as to whether whatever we're doing is enough to justify a roll of film.\r\n",

Kosmo Foto Mono is a 100-ISO panchromatic black-and-white film. I think I bought it as I liked the box design more than any meticulous research that I undertook. I think it&rsquo;s made by Fomapan, but I think it&rsquo;s quite different to the Fomapan line. They suggest you can pull it to 50 and push it to 400, which I think is unusal for a panchromatic film. I&rsquo;ve not pushed it myself, and I shot it at the box 100 speed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/Kosmos-film-review/kosmos-1.jpg\" alt=\"The photo that attracts the most remarks\" title=\"The photo that attracts the most remarks\"></p>\n<p>As I said, I bought it mostly on a whim, I think I was just picking a random selection of things to try out.

Kosmo Foto Mono is a 100-ISO panchromatic black-and-white film. I think I bought it as I liked the box design more than any meticulous research that I undertook. I think it's made by Fomapan, but I think it's quite different to the Fomapan line. They suggest you can pull it to 50 and push it to 400, which I think is unusal for a panchromatic film. I've not pushed it myself, and I shot it at the box 100 speed.\r\n\r\n![The photo that attracts the most remarks](https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/Kosmos-film-review/kosmos-1.jpg \"The photo that attracts the most remarks\")\r\n\r\nAs I said, I bought it mostly on a whim, I think I was just picking a random selection of things to try out.

They stand there and watch me take it out my bag or pick it up from its  resting place on my desk and begin the peeling process.

A single peel is  very achievable, even by the most novice of big orange eater. If the  skin is thin then it can be slow going, especially if you get into the  pick off tiny pieces mode. I recommend just skipping straight to the  knife and cutting it into segments if you find yourself in this  situation.</p>\n<p>Start by rolling it around in your hands, then  alternative squeezing it with your thumbs. You&rsquo;re trying to &ldquo;soften it  up&rdquo; I find it helps relax or even break the bond of the skin to the  segments. However, you don&rsquo;t want to squeeze it too much as you might  burst the cell walls and end up in a messy situation. The next stage is  the first pierce of the skin. I like to find a spot around the Tropic of Cancer - imagine the orange as the Earth with the top that connects to  the tree as the North Pole. You pinch the skin together a little to try  and raise it away from the flesh. Do this with your thumb and index  finger, then pierce the skin with your thumb. You don&rsquo;t need to have big or sharp nails to do this. You need a nail but mine are short and work  just fine. Once you&rsquo;re in, then it&rsquo;s about trying to pull away the skin  without it breaking too soon. You&rsquo;re trying to peel off a reasonable  sized piece first, so that you have a good perimeter of skin in which to attack next. I use my thumb under the skin to separate it and work more of it away from the flesh. Once I have a decent sized piece, maybe 2&quot; / 5 cm diameter piece, then I head up to the North Pole to pull out the  pith stalk that&rsquo;s inside. It has quite a big of friction and if you try  with a too small piece of skin first then you risk breaking the skin  away from the top and having to tackle it again in a harder manner. Once this is done then it&rsquo;s a case of going around the rest of the skin with your thumb underneath and prising away more until it&rsquo;s all done.  Depending on the type of orange the South Pole can be tricker and  generally messier. This is where you might get a belly button looking  part which has lots of tiny segments inside all linked together in  middle segment of a cone shape. Depending on what&rsquo;s there I often find  that leaving the very southern tip still with skin on and then opening  up the orange into two halves makes getting this part out much easier.  It&rsquo;ll generally come away in two pieces on each half. It&rsquo;ll have some  orange on it that you could eat. However, if this is your first time I&rsquo;d suggest just composting that part with the skin and worry about it  another day.</p>\n<p>From there you can just peel off large chunks of  white pith that you probably don&rsquo;t want to eat and then peel each  segment apart from the main group and enjoy. If the segments are torn or some came off with the skin then you just have to improvise and eat as  it comes. This is a situation which I can very clearly see why some  people would be put off. That brings us nicely to the second main reason why people don&rsquo;t eat big oranges:</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-mess-\">The Mess 😱</h3>\n<p>This is  particularly important when you&rsquo;re not at home in the comfort of your  own kitchen or shower. This is where people at work look at you  dumbfounded. The risk you&rsquo;ve introduced into the workplace by bringing,  peeling and then eating a big orange when you never quite know the  outcome of the peeling is, in many people&rsquo;s view, unacceptable. The only credible mitigation that they&rsquo;d accept is not eating the orange in the  first place. Elimination, as the highest tier of risk mitigation  strategy, is all they&rsquo;d consider. This is where I feel they&rsquo;re missing  out. With great risk, comes great reward.

Probably you want to practice this at  home as you might get even more comments than merely eating a big orange in the first place.

You can submit any photo as long as it has been taken with a X100  series camera. As most of my photos are of family and friends, I didn’t  have too many that might be suitable and this astro shot was the one I  immediately thought of. The first prize was a brand new, shiny X100V.  They had multiple first prizes for different regions, so I wasn’t  competing against everyone, just everyone in the UK!</p>\n<p>The following February I got an email saying I was one of the 10 runners up! Woohoo!  🎉 (although would’ve been nice to win the camera given I’d just  recently sold my X100F and was missing it a little bit 📷). My prize was a nice tote bag, and a hand written congratulations note. The other  part was that they would print and display the photo in their gallery.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/I-have-a-photo-in-an-actual-gallery/x100-prize.jpg\" alt=\"The Prize\" title=\"The Prize\"></p>\n<p>Except then COVID had locked everything down and they decided to postpone it a few times. However, now the gallery is open! Unfortunately, I live a  long way from London and I’m not going there any time soon, so I won’t  get to see it in person. They have offered to post it up to me after the exhibition, so that’ll be nice.</p>\n<p>The Fujifilm store looks like a  nice play to go if you like photography and cameras, they always have  gallery one and no doubt lots of toys to play with.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/I-have-a-photo-in-an-actual-gallery/fuji-house.jpg\" alt=\"House of Photography\"></p>\n<p>I believe <del>it’s</del> was open now until 30th June 2022. <a href=\"https://fujifilm-houseofphotography.com/\">Have a look at their site.</a></p>\n<p><em>Update =  They&rsquo;ve since posted the framed version to me at home.

You can submit any photo as long as it has been taken with a X100  series camera. As most of my photos are of family and friends, I didn’t  have too many that might be suitable and this astro shot was the one I  immediately thought of. The first prize was a brand new, shiny X100V.  They had multiple first prizes for different regions, so I wasn’t  competing against everyone, just everyone in the UK!\r\n\r\nThe following February I got an email saying I was one of the 10 runners up! Woohoo!  🎉 (although would’ve been nice to win the camera given I’d just  recently sold my X100F and was missing it a little bit 📷). My prize was a nice tote bag, and a hand written congratulations note. The other  part was that they would print and display the photo in their gallery.\r\n\r\n![The Prize](https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/I-have-a-photo-in-an-actual-gallery/x100-prize.jpg \"The Prize\")\r\n\r\nExcept then COVID had locked everything down and they decided to postpone it a few times. However, now the gallery is open! Unfortunately, I live a  long way from London and I’m not going there any time soon, so I won’t  get to see it in person. They have offered to post it up to me after the exhibition, so that’ll be nice.\r\n\r\nThe Fujifilm store looks like a  nice play to go if you like photography and cameras, they always have  gallery one and no doubt lots of toys to play with.\r\n\r\n![House of Photography](https://alexjj.com/blog/2022/I-have-a-photo-in-an-actual-gallery/fuji-house.jpg)\r\n\r\nI believe ~~it’s~~ was open now until 30th June 2022. [Have a look at their site.](https://fujifilm-houseofphotography.com/)\r\n\r\n*Update =  They've since posted the framed version to me at home. Now I just need to decide what I'm doing with it.*\r\n",

				"title": "Generating lots of tiddlers",
				"content_html": "<p>For my <a href=\"https://alexjj.github.io/Meditations/\">Meditations Tiddlywiki</a>, I wanted to make each statement an individual tiddler.  Whilst it doesn&rsquo;t add a great deal to the site right now (beyond just viewing the minimum amount, the random tiddler button, and following the tiddlywiki mantra), I think it&rsquo;ll be useful later on. Over time I&rsquo;d like to add my own thoughts or interpretations to them, or maybe categorise favourite ones with new tags. Plus they might be useful for other people who can export tiddlers or download the file.</p>\n<p>I had the site previously but it was one tiddler per book, and that didn&rsquo;t make it very usable beyond just reading.</p>\n<p>I find the easiest way to import lots of tiddlers is via a JSON file. Luckily I&rsquo;d found a JSON file of Meditations some time ago. It&rsquo;s easy to find the text but that&rsquo;s not always as easily parsed as as structured document. The JSON was just book and then each line. I still needed to get the title, tags, and fields sorted out before I could import into a blank Tiddlywiki.</p>\n<p>The general structure of JSON to be imported looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-json\" data-lang=\"json\">[\n    {\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;created&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;20211215114254021&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;text&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;More content&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;tags&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Home [[Book 1]]&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;title&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;2nd tiddler&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;modified&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;20211215114322673&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;book&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;3&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;section&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;12&#34;</span>\n    },\n    {\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;created&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;20211215112427768&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;text&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Content&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;tags&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Home&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;title&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Meditations&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;modified&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;20211215112535190&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;section&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;1&#34;</span>,\n        <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&#34;book&#34;</span>: <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;2&#34;</span>\n    }\n]\n</code></pre></div><p>The <code>section</code> and <code>book</code> are fields I added and the rest should be obvious. Tags with spaces need to be in <code>[[ ]]</code>. So all I&rsquo;d need to do is iterate over the JSON file and create new entries that matched this structure.</p>\n<p>The first issue I came across was knowing how many sections per book there are. I made a new list of the number of sections and stored that in the meditations.json file. Whilst not necessary (as I could&rsquo;ve used the code to generate this later on), I thought it might be helpful and more efficient to compute it once and store the results. <code>data</code> is the json file as you&rsquo;ll see shortly.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-python\" data-lang=\"python\">sectionCount <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> [len(data[<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;meditations&#34;</span>][<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">f</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">{</span>x<span style=\"color:#e6db74\">}</span><span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;</span>]) <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span> x <span style=\"color:#f92672\">in</span> range(<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1</span>,<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">13</span>)]\n</code></pre></div><p>So now that I have everything it was just a case of building the list in the format I wanted and writing it to a file.

Whilst it doesn't add a great deal to the site right now (beyond just viewing the minimum amount, the random tiddler button, and following the tiddlywiki mantra), I think it'll be useful later on. Over time I'd like to add my own thoughts or interpretations to them, or maybe categorise favourite ones with new tags. Plus they might be useful for other people who can export tiddlers or download the file.\r\n\r\nI had the site previously but it was one tiddler per book, and that didn't make it very usable beyond just reading.\r\n\r\nI find the easiest way to import lots of tiddlers is via a JSON file. Luckily I'd found a JSON file of Meditations some time ago. It's easy to find the text but that's not always as easily parsed as as structured document. The JSON was just book and then each line. I still needed to get the title, tags, and fields sorted out before I could import into a blank Tiddlywiki.\r\n\r\nThe general structure of JSON to be imported looks like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"created\": \"20211215114254021\",\r\n        \"text\": \"More content\",\r\n        \"tags\": \"Home [[Book 1]]\",\r\n        \"title\": \"2nd tiddler\",\r\n        \"modified\": \"20211215114322673\",\r\n        \"book\": \"3\",\r\n        \"section\": \"12\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"created\": \"20211215112427768\",\r\n        \"text\": \"Content\",\r\n        \"tags\": \"Home\",\r\n        \"title\": \"Meditations\",\r\n        \"modified\": \"20211215112535190\",\r\n        \"section\": \"1\",\r\n        \"book\": \"2\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `section` and `book` are fields I added and the rest should be obvious. Tags with spaces need to be in `[[ ]]`. So all I'd need to do is iterate over the JSON file and create new entries that matched this structure.\r\n\r\nThe first issue I came across was knowing how many sections per book there are. I made a new list of the number of sections and stored that in the meditations.json file. Whilst not necessary (as I could've used the code to generate this later on), I thought it might be helpful and more efficient to compute it once and store the results. `data` is the json file as you'll see shortly.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsectionCount = [len(data[\"meditations\"][f\"{x}\"]) for x in range(1,13)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now that I have everything it was just a case of building the list in the format I wanted and writing it to a file. Here's the code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\n\r\nwith open(\"meditations.json\", \"r\") as read_file:\r\n    data = json.load(read_file)\r\n\r\nbook_names = [\r\n    \"Book I\",\r\n    \"Book II\",\r\n    \"Book III\",\r\n    \"Book IV\",\r\n    \"Book V\",\r\n    \"Book VI\",\r\n    \"Book VII\",\r\n    \"Book VIII\",\r\n    \"Book IX\",\r\n    \"Book X\",\r\n    \"Book XI\",\r\n    \"Book XII\",\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nresult = []\r\n\r\nfor book in range(12):\r\n    for section in range(data[\"sectionCount\"][book]):\r\n        book_name = book_names[book]\r\n        title = f\"{book_name} - Section {section + 1}\"\r\n        tags = f\"[[{book_name}]]\"\r\n        quote = data['meditations'][f\"{book + 1}\"][section]\r\n\r\n        # Create each tiddler\r\n        entry = dict()\r\n        entry[\"created\"] = \"-01800000000000000\"  # that's 180BC\r\n        entry[\"text\"] = quote\r\n        entry[\"tags\"] = tags\r\n        entry[\"title\"] = title\r\n        entry[\"section\"] = f\"{section + 1}\"\r\n        entry[\"book\"] = f\"{book + 1}\"\r\n\r\n        result.append(entry)\r\n\r\n# Write to json file\r\nwith open(\"tw_data.json\", \"w\") as write_file:\r\n    json.dump(result, write_file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started going down the route of converting the book number to roman numerals but given the one off nature of this I just made a list of the names I wanted for the books. 😅\r\n\r\nI then just imported into a blank Tiddlywiki, made a few other pages and a table of contents macro tiddler and it's good to go!\r\n\r\n[You can see the code and json data here.](https://github.com/alexjj/Meditations)\r\n",

If a friend is driving to your house, 50 miles away, and they travel at 50 mph it&rsquo;ll take then one hour right? Well, not always. Maybe they are keen on the gas and drive faster, or maybe there&rsquo;s an accident and they get stuck. You just never know. So you could use monte carlo to say that their average journey speed could be from 40-60 mph, then you randomly sample many many times from that range and work out the time it takes. Do it 10,000 times and you then have 10,000 results that you can draw estimates from, e.g. the average time. You can also plot the results and show the whole range.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools\">Tools</h2>\n<p>The main python tools to get this working is <a href=\"https://numpy.org/\">numpy</a> for the random sampling and <a href=\"https://www.xlwings.org/\">xlwings</a> for interacting with Excel.

Sometimes is a continuous range, like our speed example before, or it&rsquo;s discrete, like picking your starter Pokémon. In fact whatever the uncertainity is, numpy has a <a href=\"https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/index.html\">method</a> to help you represent it. I actually think working out what your uncertainity looks like is the hardest part of all of it. Perhaps you could even have uncertainity on the uncertainity&hellip;Generally you want to ask an expert, maybe yourself, maybe someone else in your company, or whatever you can find online that seems reasonable. You can, of course, just try different ones in your model and see if it actually makes a difference to the decision you&rsquo;re trying to make.</p>\n<p>I ened up using <code>choice</code> and <code>uniform</code> distributions. Choice being my starter Pokémon, and uniform distribution being a range of numbers but they&rsquo;re all equally likely to be picked.</p>\n<p>My choice was actually choosing a range of numbers in Excel which would all change depending on what choice was picked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-code\">The Code</h2>\n<p>So in all its glory:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\"

Fairly basic stuff otherwise, which I&rsquo;m sure can be done better but was good enough for me. Being so simple makes it pretty easy to understand, even if you&rsquo;ve never used these libraries before.</p>\n<p>The whole thing is a loop that does the random sampling, insert those values into excel, excel then recalculates, then it takes the answer out and appends it to a list. Repeat that <code>iterations</code> times and there&rsquo;s my data.</p>\n<p>I create a pandas dataframe (probably lazy and it could be done in numpy but as I said, lazy.) from the list and then calculate some metrics from it. The P values are commonly used at work to express the range. Where P90 meaning 90% probability that the value is ≤ X. Or often viewed as most optimistic result, with P10 therefore being the most pessimistic result. Actually, I&rsquo;ve seen companies define these in reverse so check before you confuse people.</p>\n<p>Seaborn has a handy empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf), that saves me thinking anything whatsoever (that&rsquo;s the whole objective whilst at work right?). So I make one of those for the PowerPoint, and print out the final numbers in a nice line.</p>\n<p>The other nice thing with VS Code is the data viewer. I can save the plot to a file and copy and paste the table of results straight from it without having to write it to a file first. Tiny things like that make life so much easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So pretty straight forward to make your deterministic Excel model into a fully probabilistic model capturing all the uncertainity and demonstrating all the potential outcomes that can happen. For free, in about 30 minutes of work.</p>\n<p>I think probabilistic models should be used more often. Very rarely is it that everything is always known exactly and whilst your calculation isn&rsquo;t wrong, it&rsquo;s only one possible outcome. Better to give your decision maker (or yourself) a range of outcomes than just one. Tell them &ldquo;they&rsquo;re buying the curve&rdquo;. Then hope the final result actually lands on the curve 😅</p>\n",

Perhaps you could even have uncertainity on the uncertainity...Generally you want to ask an expert, maybe yourself, maybe someone else in your company, or whatever you can find online that seems reasonable. You can, of course, just try different ones in your model and see if it actually makes a difference to the decision you're trying to make.\r\n\r\nI ened up using `choice` and `uniform` distributions. Choice being my starter Pokémon, and uniform distribution being a range of numbers but they're all equally likely to be picked.\r\n\r\nMy choice was actually choosing a range of numbers in Excel which would all change depending on what choice was picked.\r\n\r\n## The Code\r\n\r\nSo in all its glory:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport seaborn as sns\r\nimport xlwings as xw\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\nexcel = r\"myexcel.xlsx\"\r\n\r\nwb = xw.Book(excel)\r\nsheet = wb.sheets['Control Sheet']\r\n\r\nrng = np.random.default_rng()\r\n\r\niterations = 1000\r\nPOWER_LOWER = 100\r\nPOWER_UPPER = 120\r\nCAPITAL_LOWER = 10000\r\nCAPITAL_HIGHER = 30000\r\nCO2_OPTIONS = [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\n\r\nnpv = []\r\n\r\nfor i in range(iterations):\r\n    power_price = rng.uniform(low=POWER_LOWER, high=POWER_UPPER)\r\n    capital_cost = rng.uniform(low=CAPITAL_LOWER, high=CAPITAL_HIGHER)\r\n    co2_price = np.random.choice(CO2_OPTIONS)\r\n\r\n    sheet.range('B3').value = power_price / 80\r\n    sheet.range('B4').value = capital_cost\r\n    sheet.range('B9').value = co2_price\r\n    npv_new = sheet.range('B7').value\r\n\r\n    npv.append(npv_new)\r\n\r\nresults = pd.DataFrame(data={'NPV10 £MM': npv})\r\nP90 = results.quantile(0.9)[0]\r\nP50 = results.quantile(0.5)[0]\r\nP10 = results.quantile(0.1)[0]\r\nEV = results.mean()[0]\r\n\r\nsns.displot(results, kind=\"ecdf\")\r\n\r\nprint(f\"EV: £{EV:.1f}MM, P10: £{P10:.1f}MM, P50: £{P50:.1f}MM, P90: £{P90:.1f}MM\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI made a few controls at the top so I could adjust the ranges of things. Fairly basic stuff otherwise, which I'm sure can be done better but was good enough for me. Being so simple makes it pretty easy to understand, even if you've never used these libraries before.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is a loop that does the random sampling, insert those values into excel, excel then recalculates, then it takes the answer out and appends it to a list. Repeat that `iterations` times and there's my data.\r\n\r\nI create a pandas dataframe (probably lazy and it could be done in numpy but as I said, lazy.) from the list and then calculate some metrics from it. The P values are commonly used at work to express the range. Where P90 meaning 90% probability that the value is ≤ X. Or often viewed as most optimistic result, with P10 therefore being the most pessimistic result. Actually, I've seen companies define these in reverse so check before you confuse people.\r\n\r\nSeaborn has a handy empirical cumulative distribution function (ecdf), that saves me thinking anything whatsoever (that's the whole objective whilst at work right?). So I make one of those for the PowerPoint, and print out the final numbers in a nice line.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other nice thing with VS Code is the data viewer. I can save the plot to a file and copy and paste the table of results straight from it without having to write it to a file first. Tiny things like that make life so much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nSo pretty straight forward to make your deterministic Excel model into a fully probabilistic model capturing all the uncertainity and demonstrating all the potential outcomes that can happen. For free, in about 30 minutes of work.\r\n\r\nI think probabilistic models should be used more often. Very rarely is it that everything is always known exactly and whilst your calculation isn't wrong, it's only one possible outcome. Better to give your decision maker (or yourself) a range of outcomes than just one. Tell them \"they're buying the curve\". Then hope the final result actually lands on the curve 😅\r\n",

				"content_html": "<p>⚠️\nThis guide is considerably old. However, the concept will still work but likely the configuration is now different.\n:::</p>\n<p><em>My version of getting started with beancount.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The aim of this post is to walk you through my setup of how I manage my personal finances. I&rsquo;ve read similar posts like these and found them useful to get ideas about what to do myself. Hopefully in turn, by presenting my setup it&rsquo;ll give you some ideas too.</p>\n<p>At the core of system is <a href=\"http://furius.ca/beancount/\">beancount</a>. I&rsquo;ll explain it a little more shortly, but essentially it is a tool that reads a plain text file of my financial activity and undertakes double-entry accounting in order to easily assess my finances in any way imaginable. My whole system actually involves several other tools and services in order to make it work how I want.</p>\n<p>Using a tool like beancount means I am free to set everything up the way I want that works for me, and not the way someone thinks I want it. It also means my data is free from constraints.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-wanted\">What I wanted</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Data stored in plain text</li>\n<li>Add information quickly, and from anywhere</li>\n<li>A tool that could do everything - transactions, multiple currencies, stocks, investing, taxes, etc.</li>\n<li>A tool that could answer any question I had about my finances</li>\n<li>Fancy graphs on a website I could safely access anywhere</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is what I have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/spacemacs.png\" alt=\"Plain Text\" title=\"Plain text in emacs with Spacemacs\">\n<img src=\"https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/fava-screenshot-02.png\" alt=\"Fava web ui\" title=\"Fava web ui\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-background\">The Background</h2>\n<p>:::{.callout-tip title=&ldquo;tl;dr&rdquo;}\nledger-cli like financial tools are the best.\n:::</p>\n<p>Finding your system takes time and there can be many decisions to make. It took me a long time to realise the benefit of tracking my expenses and what my money was doing. When I did first start I used <a href=\"https://www.youneedabudget.com/\">YNAB</a>, You Need A Budget. I didn&rsquo;t really need a budget. I wasn&rsquo;t living pay cheque to pay cheque and had some savings, but I had no idea how much I should or could save a year or how much was I actually spending. What really was the cost of that holiday? My friend had started using YNAB, and I picked it up in a Steam sale for $15. It&rsquo;s pretty decent, easy to use, import transactions, tracking, graphs. I liked it. The first problem I found was that it wasn&rsquo;t setup for more than one currency. If you wanted more you had to make two separate budgets, and this meant that my expense categories ended up being a bit weird and after about 9 months of use I found I hadn&rsquo;t set them up well. This ultimately meant I could get the information I wanted out of the tool. I could go back and adjust all the expenses into different accounts but I didn&rsquo;t want to spend that time, and even then I&rsquo;d still have to export everything into a spreadsheet to do further calculations. I&rsquo;d also read some rumours that the next version was going to be a web only tool.</p>\n<p>Now YNAB keeps it&rsquo;s data in some particular way and whilst there&rsquo;s an export all function from the tool, I was worried about longevity of it. This was reinforced when they released the new version that is web only and announced they&rsquo;d stop support for the desktop application after one year. Probably it&rsquo;ll work for many years forward, but one day something will be changed and it&rsquo;ll cease to work. Also the new version was going to have a monthly subscription&hellip;</p>\n<p>So I started my search for <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Other#Finance\">alternatives</a>. Another feature I wanted was for it to be open source and natively run on linux, YNAB did via wine, but certainly wasn&rsquo;t open source and that always bugged me. I try to encourage others to support and use open source and here I was doing the opposite. I had kept a duplicate ledger using GNUCash when I started with YNAB to see if I liked either of them, and I installed KMyMoney and even tried LibreOffice database program but they all had annoyances with multiple currencies and other things. Having something that could manage multiple currencies turned out to be my main decision criteria, and that&rsquo;s when I finally sat down and read the <a href=\"http://ledger-cli.org/\">ledger</a> manual.</p>\n<p>For about 3 months I started using YNAB and ledger side by side and I came to realise that ledger was the perfect tool for me. It effortlessly handles multiple currencies, I can query my data any which way I like and all my data is stored as plain text I can version control and easily read for the rest of my life. Actually, I started with beancount first for a week or two but then switched to ledger. After four months I ended up going back to beancount.</p>\n<h3 id=\"beancount\">Beancount</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got here and don&rsquo;t know what double-entry accounting or beancount or ledger are, I&rsquo;m going to link you to this <a href=\"http://plaintextaccounting.org/\">great site</a> which explains it all.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m also going to save why I chose beancount over ledger for another post. The basics are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Beancount (like HLedger) reads the file then orders the transactions before processing; Ledger processes them in the order they appear. This means with beancount I can lay out my files anyway I want.</li>\n<li>Strict rules on writing transaction. This is the bit I touch, I&rsquo;m bound to do it wrong.</li>\n<li>Being able to close accounts when they&rsquo;re done, so they don&rsquo;t appear anymore in reports etc.</li>\n<li>Cleaner (in my opinion) way of balance assertions</li>\n<li>I found the query syntax easier to understand</li>\n<li>and some other misc things.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The thing that made me switch? Seeing <a href=\"https://github.com/beancount/fava\">fava</a>. This is an awesome project and the author has made several other contributions to the beancount world, one of which is the organised <a href=\"https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/\">docs</a>.</p>\n<p>Beancount is by no means perfect, but it fits well in my system.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-system\">The System</h2>\n<p>Now to talk about the parts that make up my finances system. These are all the tools/apps that I use which I&rsquo;ll explain.</p>\n<p>Components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://furius.ca/beancount/\">beancount</a>: The accounting tool written and maintained by Martin Blais.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beancount/fava\">fava</a> A web interface to my data. Here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://fava.pythonanywhere.com\">demo</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://spacemacs.org/\">spacemacs</a>: Emacs and Vim ready to go.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackedit.io/\">stackedit</a>: In-browser editor. Many alternatives out there.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keep.google.com\">Google Keep</a>: Google&rsquo;s note taking tool - good for quick notes on my phone on the go.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexjj/money-scripts/blob/master/ukindexprices.py\">Python price importer script</a>: Of my own creation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/\">Dropbox</a>: Cross platform file syncing tool</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pythonanywhere.com\">pythonanywhere</a>: Host, run, and code Python in the cloud.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in\">Gitlab</a>: Git as a service, and unlimited free private repos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The whole system is based around writing transactions that beancount can process and then analysing the data through fava.</p>\n<p>The other tools aid me in doing this at home and away, although away generally means at work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"entering-data\">Entering Data</h2>\n<h3 id=\"at-home\">At home</h3>\n<p>Plain text means any text editor will do. However, some people have written helpers, namely for <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/8b8bc8efbf51b6fcca0bfbb38a40fddcfd939a9e/src/elisp/beancount.el?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default\">emacs</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nathangrigg/vim-beancount\">vim</a>, and <a href=\"https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Beancount\">sublime</a>. These generally auto complete account names and maybe a few other features like aligning the numbers and running <code>bean-check</code> to look for errors. The emacs beancount minor mode, written by Martin, has the most features - although not as many as ledger-mode, and if you already use emacs then it&rsquo;s a no brainer.  I&rsquo;d tried emacs and vim in the past as I was curious as to what they were all about but as I&rsquo;m not a developer and spend more time in Excel than anything else I didn&rsquo;t have the time to learn them to get the most out of it.</p>\n<p>When I was using ledger I spent time in setting up emacs but it was all a bit messy and I felt like I was spending a lot of time just trying to setup emacs and not really doing what I wanted to be doing (plotting more account graphs of course!), that&rsquo;s when I found <a href=\"http://spacemacs.org/\">spacemacs</a>. This is a great project and bakes a whole load of great emacs plugins into a single and managed distribution. I probably only use a tiny percentage of the features but for editing and adding transactions is very slick. Check it out if you haven&rsquo;t. Sublime text would probably be my next best option for editing my beancount file. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to get started with and has some autocompletion, but not that great.</p>\n<p>Another reason why I stuck with emacs was to use <a href=\"http://orgmode.org/\">org mode</a> to structure my file. With Ledger I quickly found having one file with everything didn&rsquo;t work too well. Especially when using xacts comand from emacs to add a transaction, so I split it into individual account files and added includes to my master ledger file. This was okay, but meant I had to move between a lot of files and as ledger doesn&rsquo;t rearrange transactions some reports and queries gave weird outputs. I worked around this by telling ledger to print everything to a ledger.all file then running queries and reports on that, but that was a pain. Probably there&rsquo;s a better way to do it but I never found it.</p>\n<p>Anyway&hellip;I now have one file that&rsquo;s broken into headers with org and I just open or close them to see transactions. e.g.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Options</li>\n<li>Accounts</li>\n<li>Assets</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bank 1</li>\n<li>Bank2</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Liabilities\n<ul>\n<li>Credit Card 1</li>\n<li>Mortgage</li>\n<li>Loan 2</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/spacemacs.png\" alt=\"Plain Text\"></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m still learning all the keyboard commands but I can quickly add new transactions and make changes. I don&rsquo;t use any importer tools (tools to take csv/ofx file from bank and convert into beancount input) as I tend to update once a week and there aren&rsquo;t many transactions to add each time. Plus I like to look at each one and think about what we bought and if it was really worth it. This <a href=\"https://github.com/jbms/beancount-import\">one</a> looks promising, and Martin is working on a feature as part of beancount to do this.</p>\n<p>These are the beancount minor-mode keys:</p>\n<p>Key     | Action                   | Description\n&mdash;&mdash;- | &mdash;- &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- | &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;\nC-c '   | Insert Account           | Bring up selection to choose an account\nC-c C-g | Set transaction flag     | Change ! to *\nC-c r   | Refresh account list     | Read the file to update accounts for using <code>C-c '</code>\nC-c l   | Runs bean-check          | Opens a new window with the results\nC-c q   | Query                    | Runs bean-query\nC-c x   | Context                  | Shows other transaction related, bean-doctor context\nC-c k   | Linked                   | Shows related transactions. Seems to be the same as context.\nC-c ;   | Align to previous number | Aligns the costs to the transaction above\nC-c :   | Align numbers            | Should align all the numbers but doesn&rsquo;t work for me. Could be spacemacs issue though.</p>\n<p>Spacemacs has good completion from helm (I think!) so I don&rsquo;t use insert account. Mostly use the transaction flag, running bean-check and aligning to previous numbers.</p>\n<p>Once I&rsquo;ve updated my transactions I commit the changes and push to my private repo on gitlab.</p>\n<h3 id=\"and-away\">And Away</h3>\n<p>Sometimes I want to add some transactions when I&rsquo;ve got some spare time at work, to save doing it at home in the evening, or if I&rsquo;m away. All this really means is I need some way of editing my files from another computer. Depending on that other computer it can be really easy or really hard. My work is somewhere in between, I can generally access most websites but I can&rsquo;t install anything and SSH is blocked. Other computers I&rsquo;d use might be at someone&rsquo;s house or in a public place and generally all I can guarantee is web access.</p>\n<p>Again, even just web access there are a multitude of options and I keep looking out for better ones. However, as it currently stands I use dropbox and stackedit. Dropbox also acts as a nice way to sync the file between my computers at home, and it offers version control from the website for every time the file is saved  - which I&rsquo;ve used! Dropbox doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in editor, or it certainly doesn&rsquo;t work for .beancount files, so I need something else to edit it. That&rsquo;s where I use stackedit. It can open files from Dropbox and Google Drive and save things to various places too. It&rsquo;s meant as an authoring site for websites as it&rsquo;s primarily a markdown editor. There are a bunch of these sites so whichever you like. Writebox for Chrome is also a nice app. There&rsquo;s no autocompletion or fancy features but generally I&rsquo;m copying and pasting old transactions and updating the date and amount 90% of the time. It&rsquo;s not as efficient but if I&rsquo;m making use of deadtime it&rsquo;s efficient to me.</p>\n<p>For quick notes from my phone, such as significant cash transactions or ones with store cards I rarely use (and often forget to check), I use google keep. I can add a note very quickly and it saves the time and date automatically and I just add the key info. I then look at this later and transcribe into beancount at home and archive the note. I use Google Keep for other random notes but any note app you use would work. The key was finding something with a good mobile interface for quick input.</p>\n<p><em>2016-03-03 Update =  I now use Gitlab to host my beancount files so I only update on the gitlab website if I&rsquo;m not at home. Although I&rsquo;ve found it better just to use Google Keep and update properly at home (I always forget to pull changes when at home!).</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"beancount-setup\">Beancount Setup</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest parts to getting to use beancount was navigating the <a href=\"http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/index\">docs</a> to figure out how to use it. Not that the docs are bad in content, far from it. Martin writes huge quantities of high quality documents. These are hosted on google docs and makes it super easy for others to comment, make corrections and ask questions. No other project have I been able to so easily make updates or clarify points as easily. The only downside is you can&rsquo;t search across all of the files to find some particular item. Generally I have to open up two or three docs that I think the answer might be in. When I first started using it I literally opened every doc in a separate tab and read through them all and constantly reference between them. <a href=\"https://github.com/aumayr\">Dominik Aumayr</a> has made a nice sphinx generated site that pulls these links together although with the docstrings from the code in his <a href=\"https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/\">site</a>. You&rsquo;ll still need to read a lot of them but it&rsquo;s a good starting place, and I think him and Martin are working to pull the content of Google Docs into it.</p>\n<p><em>So read all the docs!</em></p>\n<p>These are good to get going:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5At-z1sP8rgwYLHso5sEy3u4rMnIUDDgob9Y_BYuWE/\">Getting started</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-gsmwK551lSyuHboVLW3xbLhh99JfoKIbNnZSJxteE/\">Tutorial</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/cookbook/index.html\">Cookbooks</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;m only going to show you the basics to get started, and point out some (probably not all) the differences to ledger.</p>\n<p>Compared to ledger, beancount requires more &ldquo;settings&rdquo; in the file. You have to open all your accounts, declare commodities and generally be more descriptive.

This is so I can do some forecasting on how much I think I&rsquo;m going to spend this year and then how much I could save. When I first started tracking expenses I became a bit obsessed and didn&rsquo;t buy anything, I was trying to maximise how much I saved. However, this soon got tiring and a little depressing. Yes, saving for the future/rainy days is very important but I should still be able to enjoy myself now. I figured it would be better if I had a target savings amount, and as long as I met that, I could spend the rest on &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo;. In fact this probably helps me reach my goals but not making saving a chore. So the spreadsheet estimates how much I could save and then I set my target based on that. When I want to buy something I don&rsquo;t need, like a new camera, I can see what my trend is and know either if I can get it or how long I should wait before I can buy it.</p>\n<p>This is only going to get easier once PIVOT BY is released for bean-query.</p>\n<p>Within beancount itself there is the bean-report function, a lot (perhaps all) of these reports are covered in fava but it&rsquo;s a quick tool to spit out something if you need it in a hurry from the command line.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;re generated with <code>bean-report FILENAME.beancount {report name}</code>.  Running &ndash;help against bean-report will show a list of the reports and what they do. This can also print out your transactions in hledger/ledger format in case you want to use one of those tools, although special features of (h)ledger may not be covered.</p>\n<h2 id=\"free-fava-hosting\">Free fava hosting</h2>\n<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to access fava, this incredible tool, from anywhere? Given the demo is hosted on pythonanywhere, I figured I should be able to host my own beancount file there too.

I left dropbox as an option in to point this out in case you were wondering.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Git / version control server\nThis is a great way as you have version control and can add a pull command in the update script. If you want to make changes on the server and push back, you&rsquo;d have to log into pythonanywhere and start a console to make a commit though. <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/\">Gitlab</a> does free private repos, and since writing this post originally I&rsquo;ve now setup a private gitlab repo.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There&rsquo;s two things you need to setup to use your gitlab repo automatically:</p>\n<h6 id=\"ssh-keys\">SSH keys</h6>\n<p><em>Actually this isn&rsquo;t needed if you only ever intend on pulling from gitlab.

So either commit the changes, or revert them. I&rsquo;m considering setting up something to make it easier to commit changes, but I find I rarely want to add anything on fava as it involves too much typing compared to editing in spacemacs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finishing-touches\">Finishing touches</h2>\n<p>Now you have the awesome fava tool to query, graph and analyse your data accessible from anywhere. If you have your own domain you can add a forwarding rule and point it at <a href=\"https://USER.pythonanywhere.com\">https://USER.pythonanywhere.com</a> so you can go to myawesomemoneysite.com and there&rsquo;s your data.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d suggest subscribing to the mailing lists, or at least favouriting them on <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beancount\">google groups</a>, join the irc channels and trying it all yourself.</p>\n<p>Let me know if you have set this up and any improvements you&rsquo;ve made!</p>\n",
				"content_text": "\r\n⚠️\r\nThis guide is considerably old. However, the concept will still work but likely the configuration is now different.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n*My version of getting started with beancount.*\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThe aim of this post is to walk you through my setup of how I manage my personal finances. I've read similar posts like these and found them useful to get ideas about what to do myself. Hopefully in turn, by presenting my setup it'll give you some ideas too.\r\n\r\nAt the core of system is [beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/). I'll explain it a little more shortly, but essentially it is a tool that reads a plain text file of my financial activity and undertakes double-entry accounting in order to easily assess my finances in any way imaginable. My whole system actually involves several other tools and services in order to make it work how I want.\r\n\r\nUsing a tool like beancount means I am free to set everything up the way I want that works for me, and not the way someone thinks I want it. It also means my data is free from constraints.\r\n\r\n## What I wanted\r\n\r\n- Data stored in plain text\r\n- Add information quickly, and from anywhere\r\n- A tool that could do everything - transactions, multiple currencies, stocks, investing, taxes, etc.\r\n- A tool that could answer any question I had about my finances\r\n- Fancy graphs on a website I could safely access anywhere\r\n\r\nThis is what I have.\r\n\r\n![Plain Text](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/spacemacs.png \"Plain text in emacs with Spacemacs\")\r\n![Fava web ui](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/fava-screenshot-02.png \"Fava web ui\")\r\n\r\n## The Background\r\n\r\n:::{.callout-tip title=\"tl;dr\"}\r\nledger-cli like financial tools are the best.\r\n:::\r\n\r\nFinding your system takes time and there can be many decisions to make. It took me a long time to realise the benefit of tracking my expenses and what my money was doing. When I did first start I used [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), You Need A Budget. I didn't really need a budget. I wasn't living pay cheque to pay cheque and had some savings, but I had no idea how much I should or could save a year or how much was I actually spending. What really was the cost of that holiday? My friend had started using YNAB, and I picked it up in a Steam sale for $15. It's pretty decent, easy to use, import transactions, tracking, graphs. I liked it. The first problem I found was that it wasn't setup for more than one currency. If you wanted more you had to make two separate budgets, and this meant that my expense categories ended up being a bit weird and after about 9 months of use I found I hadn't set them up well. This ultimately meant I could get the information I wanted out of the tool. I could go back and adjust all the expenses into different accounts but I didn't want to spend that time, and even then I'd still have to export everything into a spreadsheet to do further calculations. I'd also read some rumours that the next version was going to be a web only tool.\r\n\r\nNow YNAB keeps it's data in some particular way and whilst there's an export all function from the tool, I was worried about longevity of it. This was reinforced when they released the new version that is web only and announced they'd stop support for the desktop application after one year. Probably it'll work for many years forward, but one day something will be changed and it'll cease to work. Also the new version was going to have a monthly subscription...\r\n\r\nSo I started my search for [alternatives](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_applications/Other#Finance). Another feature I wanted was for it to be open source and natively run on linux, YNAB did via wine, but certainly wasn't open source and that always bugged me. I try to encourage others to support and use open source and here I was doing the opposite. I had kept a duplicate ledger using GNUCash when I started with YNAB to see if I liked either of them, and I installed KMyMoney and even tried LibreOffice database program but they all had annoyances with multiple currencies and other things. Having something that could manage multiple currencies turned out to be my main decision criteria, and that's when I finally sat down and read the [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/) manual.\r\n\r\nFor about 3 months I started using YNAB and ledger side by side and I came to realise that ledger was the perfect tool for me. It effortlessly handles multiple currencies, I can query my data any which way I like and all my data is stored as plain text I can version control and easily read for the rest of my life. Actually, I started with beancount first for a week or two but then switched to ledger. After four months I ended up going back to beancount.\r\n\r\n### Beancount\r\n\r\nIf you've got here and don't know what double-entry accounting or beancount or ledger are, I'm going to link you to this [great site](http://plaintextaccounting.org/) which explains it all.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to save why I chose beancount over ledger for another post. The basics are:\r\n\r\n- Beancount (like HLedger) reads the file then orders the transactions before processing; Ledger processes them in the order they appear. This means with beancount I can lay out my files anyway I want.\r\n- Strict rules on writing transaction. This is the bit I touch, I'm bound to do it wrong.\r\n- Being able to close accounts when they're done, so they don't appear anymore in reports etc.\r\n- Cleaner (in my opinion) way of balance assertions\r\n- I found the query syntax easier to understand\r\n- and some other misc things.\r\n\r\nThe thing that made me switch? Seeing [fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava). This is an awesome project and the author has made several other contributions to the beancount world, one of which is the organised [docs](https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/).\r\n\r\nBeancount is by no means perfect, but it fits well in my system.\r\n\r\n## The System\r\n\r\nNow to talk about the parts that make up my finances system. These are all the tools/apps that I use which I'll explain.\r\n\r\nComponents:\r\n\r\n- [beancount](http://furius.ca/beancount/): The accounting tool written and maintained by Martin Blais.\r\n- [fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava) A web interface to my data. Here's a [demo](https://fava.pythonanywhere.com).\r\n- [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/): Emacs and Vim ready to go.\r\n- [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/): In-browser editor. Many alternatives out there.\r\n- [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com): Google's note taking tool - good for quick notes on my phone on the go.\r\n- [Python price importer script](https://github.com/alexjj/money-scripts/blob/master/ukindexprices.py): Of my own creation\r\n- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): Cross platform file syncing tool\r\n- [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com): Host, run, and code Python in the cloud.\r\n- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in): Git as a service, and unlimited free private repos.\r\n\r\nThe whole system is based around writing transactions that beancount can process and then analysing the data through fava.\r\n\r\nThe other tools aid me in doing this at home and away, although away generally means at work.\r\n\r\n## Entering Data\r\n\r\n### At home\r\n\r\nPlain text means any text editor will do. However, some people have written helpers, namely for [emacs](https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/8b8bc8efbf51b6fcca0bfbb38a40fddcfd939a9e/src/elisp/beancount.el?at=default&fileviewer=file-view-default), [vim](https://github.com/nathangrigg/vim-beancount), and [sublime](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Beancount). These generally auto complete account names and maybe a few other features like aligning the numbers and running ```bean-check``` to look for errors. The emacs beancount minor mode, written by Martin, has the most features - although not as many as ledger-mode, and if you already use emacs then it's a no brainer.  I'd tried emacs and vim in the past as I was curious as to what they were all about but as I'm not a developer and spend more time in Excel than anything else I didn't have the time to learn them to get the most out of it.\r\n\r\nWhen I was using ledger I spent time in setting up emacs but it was all a bit messy and I felt like I was spending a lot of time just trying to setup emacs and not really doing what I wanted to be doing (plotting more account graphs of course!), that's when I found [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/). This is a great project and bakes a whole load of great emacs plugins into a single and managed distribution. I probably only use a tiny percentage of the features but for editing and adding transactions is very slick. Check it out if you haven't. Sublime text would probably be my next best option for editing my beancount file. It's a lot easier to get started with and has some autocompletion, but not that great.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why I stuck with emacs was to use [org mode](http://orgmode.org/) to structure my file. With Ledger I quickly found having one file with everything didn't work too well. Especially when using xacts comand from emacs to add a transaction, so I split it into individual account files and added includes to my master ledger file. This was okay, but meant I had to move between a lot of files and as ledger doesn't rearrange transactions some reports and queries gave weird outputs. I worked around this by telling ledger to print everything to a ledger.all file then running queries and reports on that, but that was a pain. Probably there's a better way to do it but I never found it.\r\n\r\nAnyway...I now have one file that's broken into headers with org and I just open or close them to see transactions. e.g.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Options\r\n* Accounts\r\n* Assets\r\n - Bank 1\r\n - Bank2\r\n* Liabilities\r\n  - Credit Card 1\r\n  - Mortgage\r\n  - Loan 2\r\n\r\n![Plain Text](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/spacemacs.png)\r\n\r\nI'm still learning all the keyboard commands but I can quickly add new transactions and make changes. I don't use any importer tools (tools to take csv/ofx file from bank and convert into beancount input) as I tend to update once a week and there aren't many transactions to add each time. Plus I like to look at each one and think about what we bought and if it was really worth it. This [one](https://github.com/jbms/beancount-import) looks promising, and Martin is working on a feature as part of beancount to do this.\r\n\r\nThese are the beancount minor-mode keys:\r\n\r\nKey     | Action                   | Description\r\n------- | ---- ------------------- | -----------\r\nC-c '   | Insert Account           | Bring up selection to choose an account\r\nC-c C-g | Set transaction flag     | Change ! to *\r\nC-c r   | Refresh account list     | Read the file to update accounts for using `C-c '`\r\nC-c l   | Runs bean-check          | Opens a new window with the results\r\nC-c q   | Query                    | Runs bean-query\r\nC-c x   | Context                  | Shows other transaction related, bean-doctor context\r\nC-c k   | Linked                   | Shows related transactions. Seems to be the same as context.\r\nC-c ;   | Align to previous number | Aligns the costs to the transaction above\r\nC-c :   | Align numbers            | Should align all the numbers but doesn't work for me. Could be spacemacs issue though.\r\n\r\nSpacemacs has good completion from helm (I think!) so I don't use insert account. Mostly use the transaction flag, running bean-check and aligning to previous numbers.\r\n\r\nOnce I've updated my transactions I commit the changes and push to my private repo on gitlab.\r\n\r\n### And Away\r\n\r\nSometimes I want to add some transactions when I've got some spare time at work, to save doing it at home in the evening, or if I'm away. All this really means is I need some way of editing my files from another computer. Depending on that other computer it can be really easy or really hard. My work is somewhere in between, I can generally access most websites but I can't install anything and SSH is blocked. Other computers I'd use might be at someone's house or in a public place and generally all I can guarantee is web access.\r\n\r\nAgain, even just web access there are a multitude of options and I keep looking out for better ones. However, as it currently stands I use dropbox and stackedit. Dropbox also acts as a nice way to sync the file between my computers at home, and it offers version control from the website for every time the file is saved  - which I've used! Dropbox doesn't have a built-in editor, or it certainly doesn't work for .beancount files, so I need something else to edit it. That's where I use stackedit. It can open files from Dropbox and Google Drive and save things to various places too. It's meant as an authoring site for websites as it's primarily a markdown editor. There are a bunch of these sites so whichever you like. Writebox for Chrome is also a nice app. There's no autocompletion or fancy features but generally I'm copying and pasting old transactions and updating the date and amount 90% of the time. It's not as efficient but if I'm making use of deadtime it's efficient to me.\r\n\r\nFor quick notes from my phone, such as significant cash transactions or ones with store cards I rarely use (and often forget to check), I use google keep. I can add a note very quickly and it saves the time and date automatically and I just add the key info. I then look at this later and transcribe into beancount at home and archive the note. I use Google Keep for other random notes but any note app you use would work. The key was finding something with a good mobile interface for quick input.\r\n\r\n*2016-03-03 Update =  I now use Gitlab to host my beancount files so I only update on the gitlab website if I'm not at home. Although I've found it better just to use Google Keep and update properly at home (I always forget to pull changes when at home!).*\r\n\r\n## Beancount Setup\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest parts to getting to use beancount was navigating the [docs](http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/index) to figure out how to use it. Not that the docs are bad in content, far from it. Martin writes huge quantities of high quality documents. These are hosted on google docs and makes it super easy for others to comment, make corrections and ask questions. No other project have I been able to so easily make updates or clarify points as easily. The only downside is you can't search across all of the files to find some particular item. Generally I have to open up two or three docs that I think the answer might be in. When I first started using it I literally opened every doc in a separate tab and read through them all and constantly reference between them. [Dominik Aumayr](https://github.com/aumayr) has made a nice sphinx generated site that pulls these links together although with the docstrings from the code in his [site](https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/). You'll still need to read a lot of them but it's a good starting place, and I think him and Martin are working to pull the content of Google Docs into it.\r\n\r\n*So read all the docs!*\r\n\r\nThese are good to get going:\r\n\r\n- [Getting started](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5At-z1sP8rgwYLHso5sEy3u4rMnIUDDgob9Y_BYuWE/)\r\n- [Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-gsmwK551lSyuHboVLW3xbLhh99JfoKIbNnZSJxteE/)\r\n- [Cookbooks](https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-docs-static/cookbook/index.html)\r\n\r\nI'm only going to show you the basics to get started, and point out some (probably not all) the differences to ledger.\r\n\r\nCompared to ledger, beancount requires more \"settings\" in the file. You have to open all your accounts, declare commodities and generally be more descriptive. I like this as it reduces the chances of errors in either what I type in or what beancount thinks I want to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your file.beancount\r\n\r\nSo a basic file will start like:\r\n\r\n\r\n```org-mode\r\n;; -*- mode: org; mode: beancount; -*-\r\n;; My legder file\r\n\r\n* Options ; Beancount options\r\n\r\noption \"title\" \"My Finances\"\r\noption \"operating_currency\" \"USD\" ; The main currencies you use\r\noption \"operating_currency\" \"ABC\"\r\noption \"operating_currency\" \"GBP\"\r\n\r\n** Accounts ; Open all the accounts you have\r\n\r\n2016-02-28 open Assets:BC:Bank:Checking    ABC ; You can specify commodities\r\n2016-02-28 open Assets:US:Bank:Savings\r\n2016-02-28 open Liabilities:UK:Bank:Loan\r\n2016-02-28 open Liabilities:US:Bank:Credit\r\n2016-02-28 open Equity:Opening-Balances\r\n\r\n; When you start you have existing balances\r\n; one way to manage this is to have an opening balance transaction.\r\n; Alternatively you can use balance and pad.\r\n\r\n** Opening Balances\r\n2016-02-28 * \"Opening Balances\"\r\n    Assets:BC:Bank:Checking          1000.00 ABC\r\n    Assets:US:Bank:Savings            500.00 USD\r\n    Liabilities:UK:Bank:Loan        -1000.00 GBP\r\n    Liabilities:US:Bank:Credit      -1890.00 USD\r\n    Equity:Opening-Balances\r\n\r\n* Commodities ; Declaring cash and stocks and imaginary commodities you use\r\n\r\n* Banking ; Keep transactions under here for banks\r\n - US\r\n   + Bank 1 ; Org more sub headings for each country/bank\r\n\r\n* Liabilities ; e.g. credit card transactions\r\n; again sub divided by country/accounts\r\n\r\n* Investments ; accounts related to investing\r\n\r\n* Another other accounts or ways to divide up your system\r\n\r\n* Prices\r\n; Price data, or maybe an include to a price file\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's probably worthwhile looking at some of the example beancount files Martin has in his [repo](https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/8b8bc8efbf51/examples/?at=default). Either example.beancount or files under the folders.\r\n\r\n\r\nA basic transaction looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nYYYY-MM-DD * \"Payee\" \"Optional Description\" #optional-tag\r\n    Account:Category:Sub-Category  1234.00 XYZ\r\n    Account:Category:Sub-Category  -123.34 XYZ ;Optional Comment\r\n    Account:Category:Sub-Category\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome differences from ledger:\r\n\r\n- Account can only be:\r\n  - Assets\r\n  - Liabilities\r\n  - Equity\r\n  - Income\r\n  - Expenses\r\n- The ``*`` has to be present, or it can be a ``!``. Generally ``!`` means uncleared and ``*`` cleared.\r\n- The payee and description must be in \"quotes\".\r\n- Tags are #\r\n- Prices are in this format:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2016-02-25 price GBP                  1.40 USD\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have unlimited sub-categories, but a good design is:\r\n`Account:Country:Institution:Account-type`\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n`Assets:US:Chase:Checking`\r\n\r\nFor expenses I got a lot of good inspiration from the [Mint list](https://www.mint.com/mint-categories). However, I'd suggest you start small and grow as you use it.\r\n\r\n## Analysing data in your browser\r\n\r\nThis is my favourite part! You can do everything from the command line but I really enjoy the [fava](https://github.com/aumayr/fava) tool to explore my data:\r\n\r\n![Income Statement](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/fava-screenshot-01.png)\r\n![Tree Map](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/fava-screenshot-02.png)\r\n![Balance Sheet](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/fava-screenshot-03.png)\r\n![Source](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/fava-screenshot-05.png)\r\n\r\nInstructions to install it from the [github repo](https://github.com/aumayr/fava#installation):\r\nInstall it from pip:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pip3 install beancount-fava\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom command line run it with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfava /Volumes/Ledger/example.beancount\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to: http://127.0.0.1:5000\r\n\r\nIt's mostly self explanatory to navigate and use. Don't forget to check out the [demo](http://fava.pythonanywhere.com/).\r\n\r\nBeancount includes the ```bean-query``` command which allows you to enter sql like code (bql - bean query language) to generate some reports. Fava has a view that allows you to enter your bql and see the result on the page and even export the data to CSV/Excel. Here's a brief example:\r\n\r\nGo to Custom Query and enter:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  month, account, sum(number) as Total, currency\r\nFROM\r\n    year = 2016\r\nWHERE\r\n    account ~ 'Expenses' OR\r\n    account ~ 'Income'\r\nGROUP BY month, account, currency\r\nORDER BY month, currency, Account\r\nFLATTEN\r\n```\r\n\r\n![bean-query from fava](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/query.png)\r\n\r\nIf you add them to your beancount file  using `query` entry and then they appear as options on the web UI\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n2016-02-20 query \"Monthly Totals - 2016\" \"\r\nSELECT\r\n  month, account, sum(number) as Total, currency\r\nFROM\r\n    year = 2016\r\nWHERE\r\n    account ~ 'Expenses' OR\r\n    account ~ 'Income'\r\nGROUP BY month, account, currency\r\nORDER BY month, currency, Account\r\nFLATTEN\r\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nA bean-query cookbook site has started where you can submit your queries and see others, check it out for more [ideas](https://aumayr.github.io/beancount-sql-queries/). The full bean-query documentation is [here](http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/query).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Beancount data analysis extras\r\n\r\nThe only other analysis I do is taking the monthly summary data and putting it into a Google docs spreadsheet. This is so I can do some forecasting on how much I think I'm going to spend this year and then how much I could save. When I first started tracking expenses I became a bit obsessed and didn't buy anything, I was trying to maximise how much I saved. However, this soon got tiring and a little depressing. Yes, saving for the future/rainy days is very important but I should still be able to enjoy myself now. I figured it would be better if I had a target savings amount, and as long as I met that, I could spend the rest on \"luxuries\". In fact this probably helps me reach my goals but not making saving a chore. So the spreadsheet estimates how much I could save and then I set my target based on that. When I want to buy something I don't need, like a new camera, I can see what my trend is and know either if I can get it or how long I should wait before I can buy it.\r\n\r\nThis is only going to get easier once PIVOT BY is released for bean-query.\r\n\r\nWithin beancount itself there is the bean-report function, a lot (perhaps all) of these reports are covered in fava but it's a quick tool to spit out something if you need it in a hurry from the command line.\r\n\r\nThey're generated with `bean-report FILENAME.beancount {report name}`.  Running --help against bean-report will show a list of the reports and what they do. This can also print out your transactions in hledger/ledger format in case you want to use one of those tools, although special features of (h)ledger may not be covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Free fava hosting\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great to access fava, this incredible tool, from anywhere? Given the demo is hosted on pythonanywhere, I figured I should be able to host my own beancount file there too. Plus I knew from using pythonanywhere before there's a really easy password protection option you can setup to keep your data hidden. So here's what to do:\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n\r\nCreate an account at [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com).\r\n\r\n![Make a new web app](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/web.apps.PNG)\r\n\r\nAdd a new web app:\r\n\r\n 1. Manual configuration\r\n 2. Python 3.4\r\n\r\nOnce it's made, edit WSGI under Code and replace everything with this. Adjust the location of your file and config.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom fava.application import app as application\r\nfrom fava.application import load_file\r\n\r\napplication.config['BEANCOUNT_FILE'] = '/home/USER/money.beancount'\r\n\r\nload_file()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave it and go back to the webapp page. Add a user and password at the bottom, I'd recommend **NOT** your pythonanywhere user/password and something long and unique, preferably generated and saved in a password manager like [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/).\r\n![Add a password](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/password.PNG)\r\nNow we need to install fava, to do this we're going to use a script that'll also be used for updating fava automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Fava Installation\r\n\r\nAgain, inspired by the [fava demo site](https://github.com/aumayr/fava/tree/master/util/pythonanywhere/fava) lets set it up so new updates are automatically installed.\r\n\r\nFrom the dashboard, go to consoles and start a Bash console.\r\n\r\nLet's pull a copy of the code, this isn't necessary but might be useful in the future.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/aumayr/fava.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the default settings, copy the config file to your home directory and update the wsgi above. The web server will then reference this. I've not found the need to change anything, but perhaps changing the [theme](https://github.com/aumayr/fava/blob/master/fava/default-settings.conf#L8-L9) might be one you do.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncp ~/fava/fava/default-settings.conf ~\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could always just pull the file directly from github if you don't want to clone the whole project:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aumayr/fava/master/fava/default-settings.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use a settings file make sure you update the wsgi file above to reference it.\r\n\r\nNow we need to make the update script:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnano update.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd this code to it, ensuring you change the USER name.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Add user bin\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/USER/.local/bin\r\n\r\n# Upgrade fava\r\npip3 install --user --upgrade beancount-fava\r\n\r\n# Reload web page\r\ntouch /var/www/USER_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake it executable and run it.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nchmod +x update.sh\r\n./update.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Installing fava from pip](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/console.PNG)\r\n\r\nYour site should now be working, but we don't have a beancount file there. To test it out you could just manually upload your file from the Files tab, along with any include files.\r\n\r\nGo to https://USER.pythonanywhere.com, enter your username and password and there's your beancount data on the web! If it doesn't work try reloading from the Web config page. If it still doesn't work, check all your files and variable names.\r\n\r\n*pythonanywhere does support SSL (https) but doesn't auto re-write so make sure you enter it into your browser.*\r\n\r\n#### Automagicness\r\n\r\nTo get fava to update automatically we simple go to the Schedule tab in the pythonanywhere dashboard and add a time and link to the update script, /home/USER/update.sh. If you find you run out of CPU usage, disable this and just do it manually every so often. I'd suggest setting the time to 23:55, so that way it runs and then your CPU limit gets reset at midnight.\r\n\r\n![cron](https://alexjj.com/blog/2016/Managing-my-personal-finances-with-beancount/schedule.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow to automatically get your beancount file. I'm going to assume you don't want to pay for pythonanywhere - as great as it is! I bring this up as it limits what methods you can push files to your account. SSH/rsync in or **out** of your account only work for paid accounts. If you do pay then you can setup a cron task on your home computer to push the file to your pythonanywhere account.\r\n\r\n##### Rsync (paid only)\r\n\r\nI find having ssh config setup is useful to make rsync and ssh easier\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat ~/.ssh/config\r\nHost pyanyw\r\n   HostName ssh.pythonanywhere.com\r\n   port 12345\r\n   User your_pythonanywhere_user\r\n   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_SERVER1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add to your crontab with whatever frequency you'd like e.g. once a day at 4 am:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n0 4 * * * rsync -avzhP -e ssh /file/path/on/home/beancount.file \"pyanyw:/home/USER/beancount.file\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Auto sync\r\n\r\nTwo methods I've thought for this:\r\n\r\n1. Dropbox.\r\nTurns out this won't work on pythonanywhere, looks like they [tried](https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/UsingDropbox) but couldn't get it working. I use it as part of the rest of the whole finance system so would've been nice to use it here. I left dropbox as an option in to point this out in case you were wondering.\r\n\r\n2. Git / version control server\r\nThis is a great way as you have version control and can add a pull command in the update script. If you want to make changes on the server and push back, you'd have to log into pythonanywhere and start a console to make a commit though. [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) does free private repos, and since writing this post originally I've now setup a private gitlab repo.\r\n\r\nThere's two things you need to setup to use your gitlab repo automatically:\r\n\r\n###### SSH keys\r\n\r\n*Actually this isn't needed if you only ever intend on pulling from gitlab. This is just so you can git push without needing your password.*\r\n\r\nThis allows passwordless access to your repo, essential if you want to automate it. It's best to make a new key, something like id_gitlab.\r\n\r\nOpen a bash console on pytonanywhere:\r\n\r\n```\r\nssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"$your_email\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen add this key to the 'My SSH Keys' section under the 'SSH' tab in your user profile. Output it to the terminal with cat:\r\n```\r\ncat ~/.ssh/id_gitlab.pub\r\n```\r\nMake sure it's the .pub one!\r\n\r\nNow we need to make pythonanywhere know of this key in a ssh config file.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncat ~/.ssh/config\r\nHost gitlab.com\r\n    RSAAuthentication yes\r\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_gitlab\r\n    User mygitlabusername\r\n```\r\n\r\n###### Update our update.sh script\r\nChange the script to:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n# Update beancount file\r\ngit -C money/ pull\r\n\r\n# Add user bin\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/alexjj/.local/bin\r\n\r\n# Update fava\r\npip3 install --user --upgrade beancount-fava\r\n\r\n# Reload web page\r\ntouch /var/www/alexjj_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow clone your gitlab repo, and update the update.sh and wsgi scripts to match your location. Restart the web server and now everything should be automatically updated and pulled daily!\r\n\r\nJust to note that if you edit the beancount file in fava and save it, the git pull won't work as you'll have uncommitted changed. So either commit the changes, or revert them. I'm considering setting up something to make it easier to commit changes, but I find I rarely want to add anything on fava as it involves too much typing compared to editing in spacemacs.\r\n\r\n## Finishing touches\r\n\r\nNow you have the awesome fava tool to query, graph and analyse your data accessible from anywhere. If you have your own domain you can add a forwarding rule and point it at https://USER.pythonanywhere.com so you can go to myawesomemoneysite.com and there's your data.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest subscribing to the mailing lists, or at least favouriting them on [google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/beancount), join the irc channels and trying it all yourself.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have set this up and any improvements you've made!\r\n",
